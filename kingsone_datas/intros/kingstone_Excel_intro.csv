	※著重理論、統計與方法的結合。適合社會科學與自然科學研究使用。
	※提供許多實證Meta分析的範例，讓讀者實際操作分析，深入體會Meta研究的程序與應用

	※新增Meta迴歸實作範例，使用最新版本CMA 3.0。
	※隨書附贈光碟內容：1.本書CMA範例　2.本書以Excel操作Meta實例

	科學是一門累積的學習課程，但在資料搜尋過程中，常會因為研究者、樣本、時間、地區、研究方法、研究程序的不同，導致相似的研究方向卻有不同的研究結果，令人有「眾說紛紜，莫衷一是」的矛盾感。再加上傳統的文獻探討法多仰賴研究者的經驗、邏輯思考加上主觀的判斷，在選擇文獻的過程當中，常會下意識選擇有利於己、忽視不利於己的研究的相關文獻，也常根據直觀的想法，主觀地統整與下結論，而讓最後的研究結果產生了偏頗。
	     
	為解決上述盲點，Meta-analysis於是誕生了，它嘗試用科學的、系統的、客觀的方法來結合相關的研究數據，是一種量化的系統性文獻探討法。迄今，Meta-analysis已在基礎研究、生物學、醫學、心理學、社會學、刑事司法、金融和經濟學、政治學、市場營銷、生態學、教育學和遺傳學等領域，開枝散葉。

	Meta-analysis不但經濟實惠，且內外效度都高，值得大家來學習。

This is a book about Microsoft 365 Excel, or Excel 365. With a new formula calculations engine and many new built-in functions, creating formula solutions and business models in Excel 365 is dramatically easier than at any time in the history of spreadsheets.

The IF Functions are some of the most powerful functions in Excel. A basic IF or IFS function can allow complex decision tree-style analysis and functions like SUMIFS and COUNTIFS allow you to calculate the sum or count of a series of results only when certain criteria are met. Learning how to effectively use the IF Functions can save a substantial amount of time and effort as well as supporting more complex decision-making and analysis. * * *The Easy Excel Essentials 2019 series of titles are for intermediate-level users who want to focus on one specific topic such as PivotTables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, or the IF Functions. The content of each title is extracted from either Excel 2019 Intermediate or Excel 2019 Formulas & Functions which cover intermediate-level Excel topics in more detail. These books are written using Excel 2019 and assuming that a user is working in that program. If you are using an older version of Excel, the Easy Excel Essentials series may be a better choice since it was written using Excel 2013 and for a more general audience of Excel users.

Fachbuch aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Mathematik - Statistik, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Diese Arbeit besch瓣ftigt sich mit nichtlinearen Regressionsmodellen. Nichtlineare Regressionsmodelle sind wichtige Werkzeuge, da viele chemische, biologische und physikalische Prozesse besser durch nichtlineare als lineare Modelle dargestellt werden. Das Anpassen nichtlinearer Modelle ist kein einstufiges Verfahren, sondern ein aufwendiger Prozess, der bei jedem einzelnen Schritt einer sorgf瓣ltigen Pr羹fung bedarf. Abh瓣ngig vom Ziel und der Anwendung werden beim Anpassen nichtlinearer Modelle unterschiedliche Priorit瓣ten festgelegt. Dazu geh繹ren akzeptable Parametersch瓣tzungen und eine gute Modellanpassung unter Einhaltung der Voraussetzungen statistischer Modelle. Es werden 61 Modelle vorgegeben, au?erdem k繹nnen auf drei Arten Konfidenzintervalle berechnet werden. Die Parameter werden mittels OLS-Regressionen, gewichteten Regressionen (z.B. Tukeys Biweight) und Bootstrap Regressionen gesch瓣tzt. Abgerundet werden die Analysen durch umfangreiche Tests der Residuen (Normalverteilungstest, Breusch-Pagan Test bez羹glich Heteroskedastizit瓣t u.v.m.).

Large corporations like IBM and Oracle are using Excel dashboards and reports as a Business Intelligence tool, and many other smaller businesses are looking to these tools in order to cut costs for budgetary reasons. An effective analyst not only has to have the technical skills to use Excel in a productive manner but must be able to synthesize data into a story, and then present that story in the most impactful way. Microsoft shows its recognition of this with Excel. In Excel, there is a major focus on business intelligence and visualization. Data Visualization with Excel Dashboards and Reports fills the gap between handling data and synthesizing data into meaningful reports. This title will show readers how to think about their data in ways other than columns and rows. Most Excel books do a nice job discussing the individual functions and tools that can be used to create an ""Excel Report"". Titles on Excel charts, Excel pivot tables, and other books that focus on ""Tips and Tricks"" are useful in their own right; however they don't hit the mark for most data analysts. The primary reason these titles miss the mark is they are too focused on the mechanical aspects of building a chart, creating a pivot table, or other functionality. They don't offer these topics in the broader picture by showing how to present and report data in the most effective way. What are the most meaningful ways to show trending? How do you show relationships in data? When is showing variances more valuable than showing actual data values? How do you deal with outliers? How do you bucket data in the most meaningful way? How do you show impossible amounts of data without inundating your audience? In Data Visualization with Excel Reports and Dashboards, readers will get answers to all of these questions. Part technical manual, part analytical guidebook; this title will help Excel users go from reporting data with simple tables full of dull numbers, to creating hi-impact reports and dashboards that will wow management both visually and substantively. This book offers a comprehensive review of a wide array of technical and analytical concepts that will help users create meaningful reports and dashboards. After reading this book, the reader will be able to:   Analyze large amounts of data and report their data in a meaningful way Get better visibility into data from different perspectives Quickly slice data into various views on the fly Automate redundant reporting and analyses Create impressive dashboards and What-If analyses Understand the fundamentals of effective visualization Visualize performance comparisons Visualize changes and trends over time

	●配色豐富才有美感？  NO！對比色太多＝沒有對比

	●標題下得越詳細越好？ NO！總結出數據的標題最安全

	●圖字設計才能吸引人注意？  NO！斜體、加粗會干擾閱讀

	．進階封包分析技巧，掌握數據來源熟悉度。
	．逐步說明的實戰範例，輕鬆學會網站爬蟲技巧。
	．清楚分類網站類型，系統性了解網站全貌。
	．多語言開發技巧，快速提升程式開發能力。
	．多元開發技巧，節省自行搜尋與研究時間。

	本書著重多語言操作應用（Excel VBA、Python、JavaScript）與多解法開發爬蟲程式、網路封包側錄分析、網站資料尋找分析，有別於坊間爬蟲書籍僅以Python作為爬蟲操作語言與單一方式解決問題的作法。

著重原理與觀念，多角度學習，效果更佳
	承襲《Excel VBA 實戰技巧｜金融數據x網路爬蟲》中提過的觀念，「爬蟲原理與觀念通了，任何程式語言都可以做爬蟲程式」與多元開發的精神。本書在加入Python後，並以Python常見的爬蟲模組來解決同一個爬蟲問題，讓讀者可從多角度去學習Python與爬蟲程式的開發技巧。

JavsScript加密混淆破解技法大公開
	JavaScript對於網頁是非常重要的腳本語言，而讀者遇到以JavaScript做加密、混淆、美化等技巧的網頁，往往就望之興嘆無法再進行分析與開發爬蟲，藉由Excel VBA、Python對JavaScript操作範例練習，讓讀者面對相關網頁不再裹足不前。

針對封包側錄與發送過程進行詳細的探討與解說
	封包分析是開發爬蟲程式最重要的一環，若封包側錄、分析、發送等環節出錯，將會導致開發爬蟲程式出現嚴重錯誤，陷入「一步錯步步錯」的窘境，要解決此問題就必須對封包發送內容能清楚掌握，本書針對封包側錄與發送過程進行詳細的探討與解說，透過工具設定與操作，明確封包內容資訊，進一步提升爬蟲分析能力。

	分析網站資料產生的流程，分成網頁操作、封包側錄與分析、連線測試等階段，將每個階段的特徵記錄、整理、歸納而成「網頁操作分析表」，讓讀者在分析網站能一目了然網頁全貌，可避免分析了後面忘了前面的分析，導致開發爬蟲程式遺漏了關鍵步驟而造成無法抓取網頁資料。

Excel 365 has taken Excel into a new era. Excel 365 is now massively more powerful than the older Excel 2019 version and supports dynamic arrays - a game-changing feature that changes best practice for many common data analysis tasks. Dynamic arrays are comprehensively covered in a comprehensive 54 page session.This book also covers Excel 365's new XLOOKUP function (the modern replacement for Excel 2019's old VLOOKUP function). You'll also find lessons that comprehensively cover the XMATCH, UNIQUE, FILTER, SORT, SORTBY, SEQUENCE and RANDARRAY dynamic array functions (none of which exist in Excel 2019). You'll also learn about spilled ranges, linked data types, fuzzy logic and a host of other Excel 365-only features.Here are some of the reasons that you should choose this book: It provides a thorough (and easy to understand) coverage of Power Pivot, Power Query, and DAX. Excel 365 now includes Power Pivot. Unlike most other books, this book will teach you the relational database and data modeling skills needed to create optimal Power Pivot Star Schema data models incorporating DAX measures. You'll conform to 24 best-practice Power Pivot rules, ensuring excellence in your future real-world data model designs.It covers the latest Excel 365 semi-annual version of Excel (Jan 2021). This is the only book that has a new edition published twice a year (to match each new Excel 365 version). This means that the screen grabs will exactly match what you see on your screen and that any new features are covered. It can be very frustrating to attempt to learn Excel 365 using an out-of-date book (and impossible to learn to use Excel 365 effectively using an Excel 2019 book). It won't waste your time by teaching basic Excel 365 skills that you already know. This isn't a beginner's book. If you are an absolute beginner, you need our Excel 365 Essential Skills book. By assuming that you are already able to use Excel's basic features, far more ground can be covered.It teaches to true Expert level. This Expert Skills book teaches Excel to an extremely high level of competence that is very rarely found in the workplace (even amongst top professionals). At Expert level your skills will be greater and broader than almost all other Excel users and you will understand (and be able to effectively use) absolutely every Excel and Power Pivot feature. You'll have a complete mastery of skills that are often even a mystery to Excel power users.

You will repeatedly hear the same criticism of most Excel books: ""you have to already know Excel to understand the book"". This book is different. If you have no previous exposure to Excel 365, and your only computer skill is using a web browser, you'll have absolutely no problems working through the lessons. Everything is concisely described in a way that absolutely any student, of any age or ability, can easily understand.This Essential Skills book makes it easy for absolutely anybody to very rapidly learn Excel 365 to a standard that will greatly impress most employers because it doesn't confuse by teaching skills that are not common in the workplace. Our Excel 365 Expert Skills book comprehensively teaches the rarer Excel skills that less than 10% of Excel users typically master (and many office workers will not have a need for). Here are some other reasons that you should choose this book to learn Excel 365: It covers the Excel 365 edition of Excel:  This book is specifically written for Excel 365. Excel 365 has now evolved into a very different product than Excel 2019. It is not possible to learn Excel 365 features using an Excel 2019 book.It is up-to-date: This book is the fourth edition covering the new Excel 365 Jan 2021 semi-annual version. A new Excel 365 semi-annual version is released every six months (in January and July) and automatically updated to your computer. We then publish a new edition of this book to support the latest update. This means that new features are covered and the screen grabs will exactly match what you see on your screen. It can be very frustrating to try to learn Excel 365 using an out-of-date book.Smart Method books are #1 best sellers:  Every Smart Method Excel book (and there have been twenty-two of them starting with Excel 2007) has been an Amazon best seller in its category. This provides you with the confidence that you are using a best-of-breed resource to learn Excel.It is the book of choice for teachers. As well as catering for those wishing to learn Excel by self-study, Smart Method books have long been the preferred choice for Excel teachers as they are designed to teach Excel and not as reference books. Books follow best-practice adult teaching methodology with clearly defined objectives for each learning session and an exercise to confirm skills transfer. With single, self-contained lessons, the books cater for any teaching or self-learning period. Many learners have learned Excel by setting aside just a few minutes each day to complete a single lesson. Others have worked through the entire book in a single day. Companies who have taken Smart Method courses include: The United States Army, Daimler Chrysler, Time Warner, Motorola, HSBC, Barclays, American Express, Allied Irish Banks, Imperial Tobacco, Volvo, Unilever, BMW, Virgin, The BBC, British Petroleum, The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, The Institute of Chartered Accountants, The Ministry of Defence, Keele University, Deutsche Bank, HBOS, Transport For London, The Performing Rights Society, Scottish Power, The Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, BAE Systems, RBS, The British Museum, The National Gallery, Pokerstars, Virgin, O2, BMW... and many, many others.

This book demonstrates Microsoft EXCEL(R)-based Fourier transform of selected physics examples, as well as describing spectral density of the auto-regression process in relation to Fourier transform. Rather than offering rigorous mathematics, the book provides readers with an opportunity to gain an understanding of Fourier transform through the examples. They will acquire and analyze their own data following the step-by-step procedure outlined, and a hands-on acoustic spectral analysis is suggested as the ideal long-term student project.

It is widely agreed that close to 60 percent of Excel users leave 80 percent of Excel untouched. That is, most users do not tap into the full potential of Excel's built-in utilities. Of these utilities, the most prolific by far are the pivot table and pivot charts. Despite the fact that pivot tables and charts have been a cornerstone of Excel for more than 16 years, they remain one of the most underutilized tools in the entire Microsoft Office Suite. Having found this book, you are savvy enough to have heard of pivot tables and charts or even have used them on occasion. You have a sense that pivot tables and charts have some power that you are not using, and you want to learn how to leverage that power to increase your productivity quickly. With only this book, you will be able to create basic pivot tables and charts, increase your productivity, and produce reports in minutes instead of hours.Within the first 3 chapters, you will be able to output complex pivot reports with drill-down capabilities accompanying charts. By the end of the book, you will be able to build a dynamic pivot table reporting system.

The question on everyone's mind will be, what is the future of Excel and VBA macros in this fast-changing world of technology? Well, rest assured that Excel VBA macros will be here until you are retired. Microsoft is aware that there are millions of organizations out there that depend on millions of macros made via Excel. They might have changed to other languages, but those VBA macros will work for them no matter, for many decades to come on the PC and the Mac. The reason for this confidence is that Microsoft still supports Excel 4 macros after 20 years since they became functionally outdated. Excel 4 comes with a primitive macro language that was introduced in August 1992 but was taken out of action by VBA in the next version Excel 5, in June 1994. Many people did not use Excel 4 for programming because it was not very user-friendly. But those programs still ran in Excel 2016 as Microsoft knew that many companies even depended on them. Microsoft has now decided that VBA is not to be extended to a platform that already does not have it. Therefore there will not be any macros for the iPhone, iPad, or Android devices. Instead, they are developing a macro language that is based on JavaScript, and it is to be extended to Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Excel Online. You may start building macros by using JavaScript even now, but it will not be fun as they still do not have a macro recorder, objects, methods, and properties. It is still incomplete and evolving with a syntax that is not user-friendly and less readable than VBA. Another problem is that JavaScript does not support 2D arrays. You need to use arrays of arrays instead. This language runs asynchronously. Therefore, you will have to design the code yourself. And it is slow but, if you are looking for a macro to run on the iPad, this is the path to take going forward. Grab this book today and enrich your Excel Macros expertise!

This text presents a wide variety of common types of models found in other mathematical modeling texts, as well as some new types. However, the models are presented in a very unique format. A typical section begins with a general description of the scenario being modeled. The model is then built using the appropriate mathematical tools. Then it is implemented and analyzed in Excel via step-by-step instructions. In the exercises, we ask students to modify or refine the existing model, analyze it further, or adapt it to similar scenarios.

Zusammenfassung: Information zum Titel Das K羹rzel RPA kommt von robot process automation und bedeutet, viele Prozesse werden durch Roboter (damit sind kleine Programme gemeint) schneller und effizienter erledigt als in manuellen Prozessen. In Excel sind das kleine oder gr繹?ere VBA-Programmierungen, die das Leben im Sekretariat oder am Assistenten-Arbeitsplatz oder in einer Fachabteilung einfacher machen. Wahrscheinlich haben auch Sie das eine oder andere Excel-Sheet erstellt, an dem zur Perfektion nur noch ein paar kleine Hilfsmakros fehlen, die seine Bedienung, die Zuverl瓣ssigkeit der Eingabe etc. perfekter machen w羹rden. Genau f羹r diese F瓣lle sind die Beispiele. Sie sollen ein schnelles Erfolgserlebnis verschaffen und Sie dazu anleiten, selber nach kleinen Verbesserungen zu suchen. Viele (kleine oder gr繹?ere) Makros finden Sie im Internet kostenlos. Da besteht f羹r die praktische Einbindung in die t瓣gliche Arbeit mit Ihrem Excel-Sheet aber die H羹rde, wo platzieren Sie einen Button oder mit welcher Tastenkombination sollen die Makros aufgerufen werden, wenn sie in ein Modul Ihrer Exceldatei kopiert sind. Hier wollen wir Ihnen zeigen, wie Sie das Excel-Kontextmen羹 aufbauen, um genau diese kleinen Helfer im Hintergrund zu verstecken und doch leicht aufrufbar zu machen. Das Kontextmen羹 ist dazu ideal geeignet. Es startet beim Datei-Aufruf, es l繹scht sich selbst, wenn Sie die Datei schliessen. Auch das zeigen wir. Sie k繹nnen es selber so einrichten. Sie k繹nnen Ihr Men羹 erweitern, je nachdem was Sie selber mit dem Makrorekorder aufzeichnen oder was Sie im Internet an fertigen Programmen (Makros) finden. Beispielcode abtippen und loslegen.

For many of us, Excel is nothing more than a basic spreadsheet, something we may use on the odd occasion, but for some, it is part of our daily lives. Microsoft Excel is more than just a spreadsheet; it is an essential tool for businesses. In fact, it would be fair to say that it is probably one of the most important tools that a business could have at its disposal. Some of the best uses for Excel include extracting data into charts, using it to identify problems and trends, bringing all the data together from multiple files and other sources so it's all in one easy-to-use place and much more. The basis of Excel lies in formulas and functions, used for storing data and retrieving it, for doing calculations, and for analyzing data, all in one simple grid format. It is these formulas and functions that provide the biggest headaches for inexperienced users and that is what my guide is all about - how to use them and a look at some of the most commonly used ones. Given that there are more than 400 functions alone and not much less in the way of formulas, I couldn't possibly go over every single one of them. You don't need to know them all though; Excel has a built-in Function Wizard that helps you to get the best function for what you are doing and built-in Formula Intellisense helps with formulas. Without further ado, let's immerse ourselves in the world of Excel formulas and functions.

This book is not for beginners. It does not teach you how to move around worksheets; neither does it teach you how to copy the contents of one cell to the other.

We discuss business models and apply statistical and financial functions. The rest of the topics we treat include using table formulas, creating range names, using names for formulas, Date and Time functions, error checking, workbook/worksheet protection, etc. We look at the Lookup functions (Vlookup, Hlookup, etc.) and the functions that can be used in lieu of the lookup functions to perform more complex lookups. Every chapter of the book contains exercises to reinforce your learning experience.

This book provides an introduction into some of the basic theories and techniques of Numerical Analysis. Its main purpose is to provide the basis for a first level college course in this field. However, it is written in a way that would help any reader outside of the classroom, with an appropriate background, to attain insight and a fundamental understanding into this field of mathematics.The theory behind the various methods are explored and, where possible, derived in an intuitive manner. Traditionally, teaching this field relied on the student performing the repetitive steps of these procedures with pencil and paper or programming the algorithms on a computer using any one of a number of languages (e.g. FORTRAN, Pascal, or C). Here, these methods are demonstrated by implementing them in spreadsheets using Microsoft's Excel. The derivation of each of the spreadsheets is covered in depth so that the practical application of the theory is highlighted. With the use of examples, the student can see the numerical techniques actually converge to the problem's solution on their personal computer. The spreadsheets are generalized so that they can also be used by the student to solve other problems.Spreadsheets, like Excel, lend themselves to performing repetitive steps without frustrating the student with the likelihood of making simple arithmetic errors which detract from seeing the beauty of these techniques in operation. In addition, basic spreadsheets are relatively user-friendly and easy to understand so the student does not need to learn or avail themselves of a traditional programming language in order to understand this topic.The student only needs a basic understanding of spreadsheets in order to use this book. Whenever some of Excel's less common tools are used, an explanation is given to show how they are implemented. An example would be to show how a user-defined function is created.There are four main sections to this book. The first section covers finding roots of equations. The techniques are straight-forward and are generally described geometrically. Newton's Method does require an understanding of derivatives.The second section deals with numerical methods for evaluating definite integrals. Clearly, an understanding of integral calculus is required to fully appreciate what is going on.Techniques for performing some matrix operations are covered in the third Section. Mainly, it shows how the technique of transforming a matrix into reduced row echelon form can be employed to address many of these operations. Familiarity with inverses and determinants of matrices would be very useful. A lot of the operations addressed by the reduced echelon transformation (e.g. finding determinants) are actually built into Excel. The book demonstrates how these are used as well.In the Fourth Section, iterative techniques for some simple examples of differential equations are covered. It deals with equations of the general form dy/dx=f(x, y) where there is one known value of x and y, it implements techniques that will allow one to find the value of y that is associated with some other value of x. So a basic understanding of differential equations is required to fully appreciate this Section.Each of these Sections illustrates the techniques by walking through specific examples. By following the examples and illustrations, the reader will be able to reproduce and use the spreadsheets in other applications.

改善是品管活動的核心，能時時改善，企業也才能時時進步，但改善不是口號，是要付出行動的，也就是說要有改善的工具，所謂的工欲善其事，必先利其器就是這個道理。統計方法就是很好的改善神器，對中高層人員來說或許不難，但對基層人員或初學者來說難免有些難以應用，因此，日本早先在日本科學技術連盟的主導下，產學合作整理出QC七工具，各行各業推行之後成效卓著，但QC七工具的規劃較偏於量性資料，後來有感於質性資料的分析也有其需要，不久之後，產學再次合作又整理出新QC七工具，這些工具的使用、活用確實使改善如虎添翼發揮甚大效用，致使日本的品質居於世界的領導地位。實踐SQC需要具有能以統計的方式處理資料的工具。此處所謂的工具是指在電腦上操作的資料解析用軟體。資料解析用軟體有統計軟體如SPSS、SAS等與表格計算軟體如EXCEL。SPSS、SAS等這些軟體的強項是較偏向量化數據，但對質性的圖形或表格顯得無力感，然而EXCEL此軟體是圖形或表格製作的強項，因此能活用EXCEL不但可以分析量性資料，對於質性資料的製作也能發揮神奇功效。本書是介紹使用表格計算軟體EXCEL來實踐SQC的一本品質管理專門書，所設想的讀者是想學習EXCEL用於製作圖表以及想將EXCEL用於實踐品質管理的人作為對象。本書的特色是將QC七大手法與新QC七大手法的計算，均利用EXCEL來製作，對於討厭利用手來計算的人來說是非常有助益的，而且對日後公司中舉辦品管發表會時，想要製作圖表的人來說，更是如虎添翼方便不少。

	統計學是一門實際的學問，貝氏統計學也不例外。廣泛加以利用，它的真正價值才得以發揮，只是當作一部分專家的工具所使用，實在有些可惜，期望它可在各種領域中受到許多人的利用。

	本書是針對貝氏理論以及以它發展而成的貝氏統計學，以容易理解的方式去解說它的基礎的一本入門書。為了使幾乎不具有統計知識的人也可理解，使用具體例子且以插圖的方式解說，並且，許多貝氏統計學的解說書所省略的計算式，也儘可能不省略地予以記載。

	大多數的解說書是利用專門的統計處理軟體，未明示計算部分，但本書以泛用的Excel使實施例更為明確。因此，貝氏統計的計算部分不再是黑箱作業，它的本質更可明確地表達出來。

	今日，資料探勘已是決策支援系統中不可缺少的重要工具，尤其在市場行銷、顧客服務、詐欺防弊、風險偵測與行為預測方面扮演關鍵的角色。愈來愈多的企業想導入這項技術，美國的一項研究報告更是將資料探勘視為21世紀十大明星產業，可見它的重要性。

	資料探勘就是在龐大的資料庫中尋找出有價值的隱藏訊息，藉由統計及人工智慧的科學技術，將「資料」做深入分析，並根據企業的問題建立不同的模型，找出其中的「知識」，以提供企業進行決策時的參考依據。舉例來說，銀行和信用卡公司可藉由此技術將龐大的顧客資料做統計、分析、歸納及預測，找出哪些是最有貢獻的顧客？哪些是高流失率族群？或是預測一個新的產品或促銷活動可能帶來的響應率，以能在適當的時間提供適當適合的產品及服務。

	本書共分為「程序篇」、「模式篇」、「實作篇」三大篇，循序漸進對資料探勘的原理與方法進行介紹，並輔以各領域的實例說明，使讀者能直接從案例中學習應用。

讓「機率統計」、「卡方檢定」這些聽起來很難的名詞成為你的致勝兵器

	最近的統計學與資料分析算是形影不離，也是商場人士不可或缺的技術。本書將以豐富的範例解說統計學與日常生活的相關性，幫助您掌握統計學的知識，從數字中發掘未來無限的可能性。

為什麼需要學習統計學

	我們每天主動收集各種資訊，卻也擺脫不了被動接收與自己無關的資訊。大部分的資訊都可透過資料與圖表提升說服力，但要判斷資訊的真偽，就必須具備統計學的知識。學習統計學的理由在於可提升觀察資料的眼力，也能判斷根據資料製作的資訊的真偽。若是只論商場的實用性，要將不透明的未來（不確定性）變得更透明，就需要具備統計學的知識。

透過本書，您將可以了解如何：
	．如何透過直方圖、平均值快速掌握資料的全貌
	．如何利用手邊的資料計算預測值
	．如何從數據中找出影響業績的因素
	．如何從有限的局部資料中了解事實全貌的作法
	．如何驗證從Excel推導的數字就是真正的結果

別再製作看了無感的數字報表了！
善用圖表來呈現，立即找出重點！


	不論是銷售報告、企劃提案或是財會的年度報告，都會彙整一大堆數據做分析，但如果拿密密麻麻的數字來做報告，很難讓人看出重點。若用圖表來呈現，就能立即看出當月、當年的銷量變化、比較出業績的高低、顧客滿意度、成長趨勢、…等等，圖表的應用範疇可是非常廣泛呢！

	．自動產生的圖表，要如何修改標題、座標軸資料或是調整間距呢？
	．想要強調圖表中最高的資料數列，該怎麼做呢？
	．資料量太多導致圖表的資料數列黏在一起，該怎麼調整？
	．產生圖表後，還可以更改資料數列的順序嗎？
	．來源資料變了，但圖表的數列沒有跟著更新該怎麼辦？
	．來源資料有空白，怎麼讓中斷的圖表連在一起？
	．想要突顯特定資料項目，只要將圓形圖的扇形分離，效果立刻呈現！
	．不同單位或資料類型想用一個圖表呈現，就用「組合圖表」來表達吧！
	．製作完成的圖表，如何與 Word、PowerPoint 做整合？

本書特色
	★「業務銷售、行銷分析、企劃提案、財會、秘書」必備的圖表製作力！
	★密密麻麻的數字報表，沒人要看啊！將大數據圖表化，一眼就能看穿起伏變化！

Every time a new version of Microsoft Excel appears, you're introduced to another batch of powerful features--most of which you'll never understand or use.

本書聚焦於「預測」此一題目！

	3.預測時用的分析手法。
	4.預測軟體跑出的結果的解讀方法及應用。
	5.預測分析手法的計算方式。

	本書雖為工程用書，但前兩個章節是介紹在商業上很重要的資料處理及作業規劃，這是對於學理工的讀者在工作上常會遇到的問題，從事商業活動或科學研究獲取大量的數據，若不加以歸納分析，只是一堆沒有意義數字，Excel可以幫您表格化、圖表化，可以進行排序、篩選、樞紐分析，這些都將於第一章中介紹。

	 

	作業規劃就是線性規劃（屬於線性代數），應用於運輸問題、指派問題、生產問題、成本問題以及航運時程的安排，Excel的規劃求解功能可以解決這類問題，也可以用來解決工程問題的方程式根（第三章）及解聯立方程組（第四章），規劃求解將於第二章詳加說明。

	 

	對於工程科學、社會科學及自然科學上所衍生出的問題，解單變數方程式的根，或為求解聯立方程組，若無法用數學解析來求解根，就必須採用第三章及第四章的幾個數值方法來解，也可以用Excel規劃求解功能解題。

	科學是一門累積的學習課程，但在資料搜尋過程中，我們常會發現因為研究者、樣本、時間、地區、研究方法、研究程序的不同，導致相似的研究方向卻有不同的研究結果，令人有「眾說紛紜，莫衷一是」的矛盾感。再加上傳統的文獻探討法多仰賴研究者的經驗、邏輯思考加上主觀的判斷，在選擇文獻的過程當中，常會下意識選擇有利於己、忽視不利於己的研究的相關文獻，或常根據直觀的想法，主觀的統整與下結論，而讓最後的研究結果產生了偏頗。

	 

	為解決上述盲點，Meta analysis於是誕生了，它嘗試用科學的、系統的、客觀的方法來結合相關的研究數據，是一種量化的系統性文獻探討法。Meta analysis不但經濟實惠，且內外效度都高，值得大家來學習。迄今，Meta analysis已在基礎研究、生物學、醫學、心理學、社會學、刑事司法、金融和經濟學、政治學、市場營銷、生態學、教育學和遺傳學等領域，開枝散葉。

	Excel → Access：資料建檔管理
	Access → Excel：共用報表資料
	VBA ＋ Access ：自動快捷精靈

	免學程式不用另外安裝軟體，最簡單易學的Office資料庫！
	一鍵搞定跨部門團隊專案合作或是滿足個人日常辦公需求！

	企業、公家機關等許多的組織及大部份的私人企業在日常業務中，
	收發訂單或財務會計等重要的資料管理或加工處理，
	多多少少都會接觸到數值、文字或日期等等多種資料。
	而大多數的人都會使用微軟的辦公軟體Excel與Access吧。
	本書的內容，是從基礎開始學習Excel與Access的協作。
	由模擬真實情境出發，首先將原本在Excel進行的訂單資料輸入、
	管理以及列印出貨單的業務移至Access。
	接著將Access的資料匯至Excel，進行資料分析之類的活用。
	根據一連串的範例實際操作，來學習Excel與Access的協作基礎。
	在本書的學習上希望在預先熟悉的知識、技巧，
	是關於Excel儲存格的公式或函數以及圖表基礎的掌握。
	至於Access是完全的初學者也沒有關係。


	▎Excel 的強項　　　　　　　　　　　▎Excel 的弱點
	● 簡單易懂　　　　　　　　　　　　● 複雜且大量資料的管理
	● 製作豐富多彩的圖表　　　　　　　● 只能做簡單的搜尋與更新
	● 豐富的函數庫　　　　　　　　　　● 報表或表單製作耗時
	● 強大的分析功能
	● 高普及率


	▎Access 的強項　　　　　　　　　　▎Access 的弱點
	● 複雜且大量的資料能更有效管理　　● 很難熟練掌握
	● 強大的搜尋功能　　　　　　　　　● 只能簡單的處理、分析資料
	● 輕鬆製作報表和表單　　　　　　　● 報表的自由度低
	　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ● 普及率低


	■將Excel與Access整合的優點
	　
	Excel和Access分別都有強項／弱點、優點／缺點。
	在工作上，不管是要選擇使用Excel還是Access，弱點和缺點都是令人猶豫的。
	　
	有效的解決方法就是將Excel和Access 整合。
	不只選用其一，將兩者適才適用的去管理一個資料。
	這樣的話就能「一舉兩得」，發揮兩者強項和優點。
	而且兩者的弱點和缺點都因為互相補足而消失。
	比起分別使用Excel 和Access，會是更佳的作業形式吧！

	整合模式的原則為以下的①和②。
	大致來說就是將資料使用Access來管理，Access不擅長的部分靠Excel來補足的方針。

	▎①將資料使用Access集中管理
	　
	將Excel 檔案分散的多頁活頁簿和工作表使用Access統一集中管理。
	過於複雜、管理困難的大量表格也能使用Access有效管理。
	資料的搜尋與更新也使用Access的「查詢」。
	輸入資料用的表單和報表基本上也使用Access來作業。

	▎②使用Excel 來進行資料的分析
	　
	從Excel 匯入儲存在Access中的資料、或是從Excel 擷取，
	使用Excel 強大的「樞紐分析表」和「樞紐分析圖」來分析資料。
	　
	①和②加上「雖安裝了Access但不習慣電腦操作的人也是少數」為前提，
	也進行以下的③、④整合。

	▎③將Access的資料使用Excel 來建立報表
	　
	假設有無論如何都想做，卻只有在Excel才能設計的版面設置，
	從Access將需要的資料匯入，貼到Excel的報表內。

	▎④從Excel 來新增、更新Access
	　
	假設無論如何都想在習慣使用的Excel上進行資料的輸入、修改，
	也可以在Excel 工作表內匯入Access的資料。

	　
	雖然還有其他幾個模式可以考慮，上述的①∼④可以說是普遍的整合模式，
	適用於許多的企業和部門。在本書中，①會在第三章、②∼④會在第四章以後解說。

	以實務為導向，學通核心功能
	看了很多書，也上過課，回到辦公室還是搞不定報表，原因是什麼呢？這是因為坊間的Excel課程幾乎都是功能導向，著重在各種工具和函數的用法介紹，但卻沒有告訴我們觀念性的東西，以致於學習的效果事倍功半，因而浪費學員們許多寶貴的時間和金錢。本書就是為了幫您解決問題而生。

	觀念重於技巧，效率才是王道
	「觀念重於技巧」是學好Excel的不二法門。如果能夠先了解Excel的重要觀念，比較不會用錯工具，或者繞遠路來解問題；您將會發現有了正確的觀念之後，過去報表中感到困難無解的問題，都會變得更容易釐清和解決，製作報表也將會變得更快速而且正確；更重要的是，企業也因此而能大幅節省員工製作報表的工時成本。

	解決企業現場的報表處理難題

 別拿了資料就卯起來插入圖表，原始資料中若有太多空白儲存格或是重複的內容，可是會影響分析的正確性及圖表呈現，圖表動工前要先學會整理資料，刪除多餘內容或加上欄列排序，對圖表製作有極大幫助。

各種圖表的整合應用
 每次只會用直條圖、圓餅圖? 其實你可以有更多的選擇。Excel預設的圖表樣式也許不是最佳設計，稍加調整配色或是字體呈現更能讓閱聽者清楚的看到重點。跳脫傳統的圖表呈現方式，搭配上函數、樞紐分析、表單控制項、巨集與VBA 讓圖表配合你的需要動起來！

主題式情境圖表
 透過常用的家計簿記錄表、員工業績統計、員工薪資費用分析、商品行銷與優勢分析、商品市場評估…等主題，可學會如何整合不同類別的圖表(直條圖、雷達圖、泡泡圖...)，讓資料能用最適合的圖表呈現，人人都可以是資料分析高手！

更多搭配與靈活運用
 Excel圖表可千萬別忘了 SmartArt ，多種預設的設計模板如流程圖、循環圖、關聯圖、階層圖….，只要輸入文字就能呈現專業設計師般的視覺效果，是圖表資料最佳的輔助工具。
 設計完成的圖表還可以連結至 PowerPoint 簡報，或轉成 PDF、XPS 的文件以 E-mail 傳送，全方位應用讓你成為職場達人。

數據職場力小測驗：

圖表種類好多種，你知道你用的是正確的格式？

主管說你的圖表沒有意義，退了好幾次？

做好圖表了，卻無法看著圖表說故事!?

	 

	菜鳥：救命～主管要我把一份資料做成圖表，要做成什麼樣子、注意哪些內容什麼都沒說，我該怎麼辦！？

	 

	老鳥：看來主管要給你一個震撼教育呢！了解資料的用途、目的，去判斷什麼樣的圖表最能表達，以及這些圖表後續還能傳達什麼訊息，這可是你大顯身手的大好機會哦！

	 

	數據不只是數字，還可以說故事！但從一張簡單的表格，要能說出有意義的故事，需要一些想像力和判斷力，在這樣轉換的過程中，Excel就是你的最佳幫手！

	 

	會用Excel，不代表有從數據中判斷出價值的能力，因此我們才需要圖表做為輔助。這本書適合新鮮人的你、想增加職場力的你、想讓主管刮目相看的你，學好數據判斷×應用×分析的基本功，下次再遇到這類的疑難雜症，就不用再怕囉！

	 

本書特色

	 

	Excel數據處理的極致，就是將數字轉換為人人看得懂的圖表

	圖表怎麼做、觀眾怎麼看、故事怎麼說

	練好這三大要素，就能決定你的職場力！

	 

	這不是一本普通的Excel操作書，而是一本結合資料處理分析、圖表製作思維與Excel技術的書；這本書也不是Excel功能講解大全，因為書中僅採用了最簡單常用的功能，就可以滿足大部份人日常的資料處理分析及圖表製作的需求。

	 

	這本書更不是死板的技術圖書，因為它融合了行業知識、統計學、應用數學，並採用最通俗易懂的講法，同時結合漫畫，讓讀者能以最少的時間，輕鬆了解這些與資料分析處理以及圖表製作的基本知識。

	 

	．找出茫茫資料中有價值的金礦

	．分析、整理資料，挖掘出有用的數據

	．將數據轉換為正確的圖表

 覺得工具書太厚重，午睡拿來趴又嫌太硬…
 看見Excel表格後兩眼發直，資料越多，視線越模糊…

 工作效率高人一等，逼著主管不得不給甲等考績…

網友試讀後，狂力推薦...

 讀完第一章，眼前的儲存格跟我前半輩子的儲存格完全不同了！會有這樣的改變，完全是作者維妙維肖地揣摩一般大眾的原本想法，接著傳達出他自己的獨門心法。我雖然不是公務員，但也從中汲取了寶貴的心得。------部落格讀者 小楊

 這本書的訴求是幫人節省工作時間，第一時間心裡面只覺得老土。試讀過第二章，發現與其說是節省時間，倒不如說是教人「懶惰」。古人說「由儉入奢易，由奢入儉難」，學會了這些技巧，套句過時的話就是「回不去了」。以前的勤勞工作原來只是不懂功能、沒有效率，幸好我在工作上並不是Excel重度使用者，否則看到此書會十分捶胸頓足、相見恨晚。------本書編輯 艾凡斯

 一聽到書名就覺得滿有趣的，原來終於有人為我這樣的公務人員出版Excel書籍了啊！故事情節真不是蓋的，活生生的公務員生活躍然紙上，輔以詼諧的精彩對話，將Excel的精華流露於無形。以後我會推薦給我的同事，也希望其他如Word、Powerpoint等系列也能快快問世。------PPT論壇管理員 小貓兩三隻

 這本書的第三章讓我想起以前求學時期邊做報告邊翻閱Excel工具書的情景。那時為了進行項目的運算分析，得對成千上萬筆的資料進行處理，偏偏沒受過這方面訓練的我，只能和小組成員討論與查找相關書籍，那時候我們的第一選擇，的確就是最普及也最容易上手的Excel。現在想想，如果當時就具備基本的資料庫處理觀念，或許報告能夠做得更快更好。------部落格讀者 Jerry

本視訊課程合集包含《Excel 2010基礎視訊課程》光碟與《Excel函數速查手冊(第二版)》書籍，共計收錄將近4個小時的視訊課程。Excel內建的函數有300多個，依照種類的不同，共可以分為10個大類，分別是文字及資料函數、日期及時間函數、數學和三角函數、財務函數、統計函數、資訊函數、邏輯函數、尋找和參照函數、資料庫函數和工程函數等。本書共分為11個章節，第一章在介紹Excel函數的一些基本知識，和函數基本的用法。第2章到第11章，則依照Excel函數的類別，收錄10個大類的函數，總計超過300個函數。本書包含了每個函數的名稱、語法之外，並且用詳細的範例，step by step，逐步示範的方式，介紹每個函數的用法。書末並附有索引，讓您能夠快速地了解每個函數的用法。不過Excel函數實在蠻複雜的，所以一般人實在無法將每個函數的用法都通通牢記在心。因此我們建議您可以將本書放在您的案頭旁，隨時查閱，隨時參考，必能大大增加您的工作效率。

Microsoft所發行的Excel軟體，是一個我們大家經常在使用的軟體。不論是在家中，或是辦公室中，我們都經常會使用Excel。有時可能是計算家中的開支，或是用Excel來製作表格、繪製圖表…等等的工作。除此之外，有一些比較專業人士，比如說，會計師、建築師、工程師、科學家、研究人員…等等，還會利用Excel來進行計算，特別是一些複雜的金融、工程、數學方面的工作。Excel之所以能夠進行如此複雜的計算，主要是因為Excel當中內建了「函數」。您可別小看了Excel的函數，事實上Excel函數的功能十分強大，從最簡的加、減、乘、除，到複雜的工程、數學計算，它都能夠一一勝任，就像是一台超級計算機一般。Excel內建的函數有300多個，依照種類的不同，共可以分為10個大類，分別是文字及資料函數、日期及時間函數、數學和三角函數、財務函數、統計函數、資訊函數、邏輯函數、尋找和參照函數、資料庫函數和工程函數等。Excel函數為數不少，而且Excel函數又都以簡單的英文縮寫做為函數的名稱，再加上每個函數都又有特定的語法，稍一不慎，就可能會產生錯誤的結果。因此有時為了搜尋某個函數的用法，經常會讓使用者感到困擾。本書共分為11個章節，第一章在介紹Excel函數的一些基本知識，和函數基本的用法。第2章到第11章，則依照Excel函數的類別，收錄10個大類的函數，總計超過300個函數。本書包含了每個函數的名稱、語法之外，並且用詳細的範例，step by step，逐步示範的方式，介紹每個函數的用法。書末並附有索引，讓您能夠快速地了解每個函數的用法。不過Excel函數實在蠻複雜的，所以一般人實在無法將每個函數的用法都通通牢記在心。因此我們建議您可以將本書放在您的案頭旁，隨時查閱，隨時參考，必能大大增加您的工作效率。本書特色:本書依照函數種類依序排列，您可以快速查尋Excel中的函數。本書印刷清晰，同時編排美觀，方便您快速查閱。本書詳細標示Excel函數的名稱、語法和用法。每個Excel函數完全用實際範例說明，讓您看了就懂。

市面上多數的 Excel VBA 入門書都從「物件」、「變數」、「反覆執行程式」等主題逐項深入解說, 這種做法雖然可以鉅細靡遺地詳細解說每個主題, 但恐怕只有學過程式設計的人看得懂, 對初學程式設計的讀者來說, 反而是很重的負擔。本書採取不同的方式。大膽跳脫廣度的內容, 而專注於某些重點上。利用簡單而且能夠逐步實作的「計算練習」與「銷售管理」範例作為本書的主軸。在製作範例的過程中, 綜合學習多種基本技術。完成某項功能後, 再回頭學習較進階的應用。透過這樣的方式, 就能體會 Excel VBA 程式設計的要領與訣竅, 並且體驗 VBA 的用處與適用時機。本書以先講解「如何製作能執行的程式」, 而非一次讓大家記住所有撰寫規則為前提。筆者認為先能夠作出可執行的程式 才是重要的。因此, 本書不是只有閱讀, 還會帶著大家邊讀邊動手撰寫程 式, 讓大家得到更佳的學習效果。對初學 Excel VBA 以及程式設計的讀者來說, 筆者建議先以本書作為塾腳石, 學習 Excel VBA 程式設計的要領與訣竅。從本書畢業之後, 再隨著自己覺得不足之處, 從市面的書裡尋找解答。 之後再查詢參考辭典類型的書以及網站, 將查到的資料實際應用在工作用的程式設計裡。如此一來一定可以確實地學習 Excel VBA。

Microsoft Excel continues to grow in power, sophistication, and capability, but one thing that has changed very little since the early '90s is its user interface. The once-simple toolbar has been packed with so many features over the years that few users know where to find them all. Microsoft has addressed this problem in Excel 2007 by radically redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate and use. Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even if users can find advanced features, they probably won't know what to do with them.  Excel 2007: The Missing Manual covers the entire gamut of how to build spreadsheets, add and format information, print reports, create charts and graphics, and use basic formulas and functions. Like its siblings in the Missing Manual series, this book crackles with a fine sense of humor and refreshing objectivity about its subject, guiding readers through the new Excel with clear explanations, step-by-step instructions, lots of illustrations, and friendly, time-saving advice. It's a perfect primer for small businesses with no techie to turn to, as well as those who want to organize household and office information.

本書適用於Excel 2007/2003/2002/2000全系列版本，作者分別為大阪大學經濟系講師、資訊公司工程師、微軟MVP。從入門基礎開始講解，藉由圖例分析逐步引導，並用註解的方式，詳細說明各個技巧的相關知識，最後更提供實際案例演練，讓讀者能從示範實作中，快速累積Excel VBA程式設計經驗，學會編寫程式碼，讓自己的工作變得更有效率！作者的話：2004 年發行，本書的上一版得到大幅超越作者預期的好評。修訂這樣受到讀者支持的書，絕不能辜負讀者期望；就結果而言，作者對本書「第三版」的內容十分有自信，一定比前作更加充實。「第三版」的修訂部份主要有三個。第一個是一邊維持 Excel 2003/2002/2000 的相容性，一邊支援 Excel 2007。這樣一來，Excel 2003/2002/2000 的使用者就能寫出能在新版 Excel 執行的程式，而 Excel 2007 的使用者也能寫出不會在舊版 Excel 發生問題的程式。幸好 VBA 在 Excel 2007 沒有大變化，所以能順利將兩者整合在同一本書內。第二個修訂部份，是改進前作「改訂版」的版面配置，同時充實註解。這樣除了讀起來更方便，還能解說更多內容。這本書其實容納了比外觀看起來更多的資訊。當然在寫的時候也有考慮到，註解、專欄之類的內容不必詳讀也能繼續閱讀下去，所以讀者可以先掌握整體概觀，稍後再回頭補充細節。而第三個修訂部份，則是把應該用不到的地方刪除，同時加入更多實踐範例。比如說Chapter 6 的「以通訊錄列印明信片」以及 Chapter 15 的「泛用資料庫系統 + 合併列印系統」就是在前作「改訂版」之後新增的實踐範例。在修訂的時候，也一併維持前作的品質，盡力維持內容「簡單易懂」。本書第三版的誕生，不僅要感謝各位讀者的支持，也要感謝所有協助讓本書問世的人們。

The dominant spreadsheet program and one of the most widely used software applications in the world, Microsoft Excel is unbelievably powerful--and can be downright intimidating.

Clear explanations (with lots of examples), step-by-step instructions, helpful illustrations, and timesaving advice guide you through all the most common and useful features of Excel 2002 and 2003--including how to build spreadsheets, add and format information, print reports, create charts and graphics, and use basic formulas and functions.Sure, there are plenty more thorough, more massive Excel books on the bookstore shelves. But why wade your way through a swamp of details you'll never need--or want--to use? Let author Matthew MacDonald, an educator and software developer who also wrote the highly popular Excel: The Missing Manual, be your trusted guide as you learn which Excel features will serve you best and which are best ignored.Utterly practical and refreshingly funny, this down-to-earth guide gives you nothing more (and nothing less) than what you need to make Excel do exactly what you want it to do. It's a quick read you'll want to keep on hand for reference again and again.

They know they could get more out of Excel if they could just get a leg up on building formulas and using functions. Unfortunately, this side of Excel appears complex and intimidating to the uninitiated--shrouded in the mysteries of mathematics, finance, and impenetrable spreadsheet jargon. Sound familiar? If you're a businessperson who needs to use Excel as an everyday part of your job, then you've come to the right book. Formulas and Functions with Microsoft(R) Office Excel 2007 demystifies worksheet formulas and presents the most useful Excel functions in an accessible, jargon-free way. This book not only takes you through Excel's intermediate and advanced formula-building features, it also tells you why these features are useful to you and shows you how to use them in everyday situations. Throughout the book you'll find no-nonsense, step-by-step tutorials and lots of practical examples aimed directly at business users.  - Focuses like a laser on the four technologies that you must master to get the most out of Excel: ranges, formulas, functions, and data analysis tools. - Shuns spreadsheet theory in favor of practical know-how that you can put to use right away. - Provides numerous real-world examples and techniques to help you learn and understand the importance of each section.

Given the improved analytical capabilities of Excel, scientists and engineers everywhere are using it--instead of FORTRAN--to solve problems. And why not? Excel is installed on millions of computers, features a rich set of built-in analyses tools, and includes an integrated Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language. No wonder it's today's computing tool of choice. Chances are you already use Excel to perform some fairly routine calculations. Now the Excel Scientific and Engineering Cookbook shows you how to leverage Excel to perform more complex calculations, too, calculations that once fell in the domain of specialized tools. It does so by putting a smorgasbord of data analysis techniques right at your fingertips. The book shows how to perform these useful tasks and others: Use Excel and VBA in generalImport data from a variety of sourcesAnalyze dataPerform calculationsVisualize the results for interpretation and presentationUse Excel to solve specific science and engineering problemsWherever possible, the Excel Scientific and Engineering Cookbook draws on real-world examples from a range of scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, and physics. This way, you'll be better prepared to solve the problems you face in your everyday scientific or engineering tasks.High on practicality and low on theory, this quick, look-up reference provides instant solutions, or ""recipes,"" to problems both basic and advanced. And like other books in O'Reilly's popular Cookbook format, each recipe also includes a discussion on how and why it works. As a result, you can take comfort in knowing that complete, practical answers are a mere page-flip away.

On the surface, it doesn't appear as if much in Excel 2003 has changed. There are a handful of new objects and the user interface is largely the same. But beyond a superficial glance, you'll see that there are fundamental shifts implied by the new features: Lists, XML, web services, .NET, and InfoPath build a framework for entirely new ways to exchange data with Excel. In fact, that's much of what Excel 2003 is all about--solving problems that deal with teamwork-- collecting and sharing data, programming across applications, and maintaining security.The latest in our Developer's Notebook series, this guide introduces intermediate to advanced Excel VBA programmers to the newest programming features of Excel 2003, --focusing just on what's new--so you can get up to speed quickly. Light on theory and long on practical application, the book takes you directly to the topics you'll want to master through a series of hands-on projects. With dozens of practical labs, you'll be able to decide for yourself which new aspects of Excel will be useful or not in your own work. And best of all, you won't have to buy an expensive revision of a legacy Excel programming tutorial to learn about the new features--if they're covered there at all.Excel 2003 Programming: A Developer's Notebook shows you how to work with lists and XML data, secure Excel applications, use Visual Studio Tools for Office, consume Web Services, and collect data with Infopath. Each chapter is organized into a collection of labs, each of which addresses a specific programming problem. You can follow along to complete the lab on your own, or jump ahead and use the samples the author has built for you.The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Excel 2003, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution.

Why program Excel? For solving complex calculations and presenting results, Excel is amazingly complete with every imaginable feature already in place. But programming Excel isn't about adding new features as much as it's about combining existing features to solve particular problems. With a few modifications, you can transform Excel into a task-specific piece of software that will quickly and precisely serve your needs. In other words, Excel is an ideal platform for probably millions of small spreadsheet-based software solutions.  The best part is, you can program Excel with no additional tools. A variant of the Visual Basic programming language, VB for Applications (VBA) is built into Excel to facilitate its use as a platform. With VBA, you can create macros and templates, manipulate user interface features such as menus and toolbars, and work with custom user forms or dialog boxes. VBA is relatively easy to use, but if you've never programmed before, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET is a great way to learn a lot very quickly. If you're an experienced Excel user or a Visual Basic programmer, you'll pick up a lot of valuable new tricks. Developers looking forward to .NET development will also find discussion of how the Excel object model works with .NET tools, including Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO). This book teaches you how to use Excel VBA by explaining concepts clearly and concisely in plain English, and provides plenty of downloadable samples so you can learn by doing. You'll be exposed to a wide range of tasks most commonly performed with Excel, arranged into chapters according to subject, with those subjects corresponding to one or more Excel objects. With both the samples and important reference information for each object included right in the chapters, instead of tucked away in separate sections, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET covers the entire Excel object library. For those just starting out, it also lays down the basic rules common to all programming languages.  With this single-source reference and how-to guide, you'll learn to use the complete range of Excel programming tasks to solve problems, no matter what you're experience level.

品質管理在企業界已極為普及，並且有逐漸定型化的趨勢。尤其是在電腦越來越進步的今日，很多產業的產品的品質，只想倚賴機械的自動化或品管作法程式化的電腦管制來達成，而忽視現場人員的統計品管與解析的重要性，使得現場的幹部及工程師不重視統計解析及統計品管，因此現場的品質不斷發生問題而無法獲得有效的解決。近年來，Excel函數能應用到統計品管及解析的方法越來越多，截至目前，幾乎所有現場使用的統計品管手法都能以Excel來計算，而成為非常方便的工具。有鑑於此，筆者將歷年來輔導各工廠推行統計品管的講義、例題或演練題目等整理編寫，並加入實際應用Excel計算的步驟，進而完成本書。本書之單數章為有關一般的統計品質管理的部份，如果不想應用Excel，只靠人算或計算機計算，單單閱讀這四個章節，就可以充分理解統計品質管理並進而在現場使用。雙數章則是實際將例題應用Excel計算並將其計算步驟及內容編著而成，對初次想應用Excel實施統計品管的人應該會有很大的幫助。

As one of the most widely used desktop applications ever created, Excel is familiar to just about everyone with a computer and a keyboard. Yet most of us don't know the full extent of what Excel can do, mostly because of its recent growth in power, versatility, and complexity. The truth is that there are many ways Excel can help make your job easier-beyond calculating sums and averages in a standard spreadsheet.  Analyzing Business Data with Excel shows you how to solve real-world business problems by taking Excel's data analysis features to the max. Rather than focusing on individual Excel functions and features, the book keys directly on the needs of business users. Most of the chapters start with a business problem or question, and then show you how to create pointed spreadsheets that address common data analysis issues. Aimed primarily at experienced Excel users, the book doesn't spend much time on the basics. After introducing some necessary general tools, it quickly moves into more specific problem areas, such as the following:  Statistics Pivot tables Workload forecasting Modeling Measuring quality Monitoring complex systems Queuing Optimizing Importing data  If you feel as though you're getting shortchanged by your overall application of Excel, Analyzing Business Data with Excel is just the antidote. It addresses the growing Excel data analysis market head on. Accountants, managers, analysts, engineers, and supervisors-one and all-will learn how to turn Excel functionality into actual solutions for the business problems that confront them.

A practical guide to building fully operational financial cash flow models for structured finance transactions Structured finance and securitization deals are becoming more commonplace on Wall Street. Up until now, however, market participants have had to create their own models to analyze these deals, and new entrants have had to learn as they go. Modeling Structured Finance Cash Flows with Microsoft Excel provides readers with the information they need to build a cash flow model for structured finance and securitization deals. Financial professional Keith Allman explains individual functions and formulas, while also explaining the theory behind the spreadsheets. Each chapter begins with a discussion of theory, followed by a section called ""Model Builder,"" in which Allman translates the theory into functions and formulas. In addition, the companion website features all of the modeling exercises, as well as a final version of the model that is created in the text. Note:  Companion website and other supplementary materials are not included as part of eBook file.

	由於，微軟的 Office 已相當普及，且廣泛地為工商企業及個人使用。本書決定以 Excel 為工具，讓您學習統計技巧，並輕鬆作統計分析應用。

	本書係將筆者於教學時，經多年與學生合作，進行實際問卷調查所收集到之資料，作為全書之分析實例的主要資料。其特性為：

	1. 具真實性且符合國情

	每組資料均是於國內真正進行問卷調查所獲得，每筆均是真真實實的資料，並非如坊間大部分書籍所使用之假設資料；或國情不同的國外資料。

	2. 具親切感

	各問卷所調查之對象，均是一般人日常生活上所使用得到之產品。如：手機、信用卡、運用網際網路情況、音樂CD、運動鞋、運動飲料、衛生棉、…。而非機械、生物、植物、昆蟲、化學、醫學、…等。

	3. 具時效

	所使用之資料為最近兩三年才進行調查之實際資料，絕對是讀者們最近還接觸得到的事物。

	4. 實例充足

	因筆者教授與市場調查相關之課程多年，所獲取之原始問卷及資料相當多。除可用於課本之本文上，多舉幾個實例進行解說外；還可供學生於課堂上進行實作演練，或於課後當作習題作業。

	5. 重過程也重解說

	每一個實例，除了不厭其煩，詳盡地逐步解說其操作及進算過程外；對其結果，也儘量以讀者較容易接受之口語化加以說明，而不是以艱澀難懂的統計術語來進行解說。

	6. 易學易用

	所談及之內容，均是一般常用之統計技巧。無導出/驗證公式之乏趣內容，也無過深之理論。絕對能讓讀者能『學得輕鬆、學得實用』！

內容簡介
　Ｅｘｃｅｌ的特徵之一就是，擁有豐富的「工作表函數」。所謂「函數」通常都是指將專門知識所需之特殊及複雜的計算式，彙總成一個容易處理的公式。平常要計算日期或時間、操作文字串、計算平均值或合計時，都需要花費相當大的勞力與時間，因此本書要以簡單的表示方式，介紹以上的計算方法。

　本書所列舉的函數都是一般人可以輕鬆使用的方法，我們採用的是以具體的範例，並以容易理解的方式加以解說。此外，我們並不只是單純解說函數而已，本書的特色就是使用具體的實例，都是使用富豐的畫面按照順序一一說明，只要按照陽個步驟輸入，即使是初次使用Ｅｘｃｅｌ的人都能馬上理解。
