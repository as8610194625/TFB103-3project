Do you want to learn Linux and its fundamentals, improve your computer programming skills and become computing expertise? If yes, then keep reading...Linux has been well-known as one of the most powerful operating systems in the world of cybersecurity and coding.Among its various components, Kali Linux is one of the distributions which can be treated like a boon for ethical hackers and IT people. However, everything comes with several problems. In this world of today, people have excessive trust in Kali Linux capabilities by default only. As a result, most users are not paying attention to the various manual aspects of Linux security. It is true that with Linux, you can automate many of your tasks. However, it also requires some manual touch for keeping everything with the pace. This fact even becomes more evident when it comes to the concept of security. Though an operating system might automate all your tasks, it is your task to be anxious always. You are required to keep a close eye on the settings of our application and various other details. When you have a well-configured Kali Linux system, it might turn out to be the most difficult thing to crack. However, most Kali Linux users do not have profound knowledge about what is required for keeping their whole systems locked up. If you start using a brand-new application, try to pay very close attention to its configuration details. Running the application with the same example settings and then using it is not the ideal option. It is not at all recommended. Some of the developers in the past also put decoy settings in the applications to make sure that the applications are prevented from running. This was a great way to ensure that all the users have checked out the file of a configuration of the application. When it comes to permissions, it forms an essential part of Linux. It is essential for a user to clearly understand how every permission functions and the implications of the various components of the OS. If you are shifting from Windows to Linux, the generalized concept might be a bit different and awkward for you. The general rule of Kali Linux is that you are not supposed to use root for your daily work. This might sound like a bit of a surprise for all the Windows users in which the operating system handles the various permissions, which are critical in nature in a different way. It is surely an inconvenient function to type a password each time you want the machine to execute a function. However, it is practical and will surely help prevent some serious security problems with your machine in the future. In this book, you will learn more about: Basic Linux commandsLinux InstallationFile SystemBasic Shell ProgrammingWhat to Do Next with Linux?Basic Kali Linux toolsCommand Syntax PatternsLinux Files and DirectoriesLinux File System SearchingUser and Group ManagementCommands and Functions for the BeginnerUsing Linux Text EditorsexercisesBuilding ScriptsSecuring Your Linux ServerGNU UtilitiesControl Privileged User...

Do you want to learn how you can protect yourself from hackers in your office and home and how to carry out ethical hacking? If yes, then keep reading...In layman's terms, hacking is the act of breaking into someone else's computer to which you have no access and stealing private information by circumventing the security measures. It is dangerous because it sabotages the entire computer system.The origin of the word ""hacking"" can be traced back to the 1960's and 1970's. Some hackers, called Yippe, were anti-war protestors and members of the Youth International Party. They played pranks in the streets, and most of their prank techniques were taught within their group. It is important to note that they were involved in tapping telephone lines as well. Gradually, what was called a prank grew to another level and became known as hacking. However, this time their tools were state-of-the-art mega core processors and multi-function plasma screens.Hacking tactics are increasingly being used by terrorist organizations for numerous acts of evil, including obtaining illegal funding, spreading propaganda, launching missiles, threatening the government and gathering intelligence about secret military movements.In this book, various types of hacking will be broken down and explained.

Do you want to learn how you can protect yourself from hackers in your office and home and how to carry out ethical hacking? If yes, then keep reading...In layman's terms, hacking is the act of breaking into someone else's computer to which you have no access and stealing private information by circumventing the security measures. It is dangerous because it sabotages the entire computer system.The origin of the word ""hacking"" can be traced back to the 1960's and 1970's. Some hackers, called Yippe, were anti-war protestors and members of the Youth International Party. They played pranks in the streets, and most of their prank techniques were taught within their group. It is important to note that they were involved in tapping telephone lines as well. Gradually, what was called a prank grew to another level and became known as hacking. However, this time their tools were state-of-the-art mega core processors and multi-function plasma screens.Hacking tactics are increasingly being used by terrorist organizations for numerous acts of evil, including obtaining illegal funding, spreading propaganda, launching missiles, threatening the government and gathering intelligence about secret military movements.In this book, various types of hacking will be broken down and explained. Step by step instructions will be provided so that you can protect yourself from hackers in your office and home, as well as on the internet. This book gives a comprehensive guide on the following: A step by step process on installing and downloading Kali LinuxVarious tools that are available in Kali Linux, which can be used for penetrating wireless devicesBasic Linux CommandsTips and tricks on Penetration Testing and Web SecurityLinux ToolsHow exploits are classifiedThe role of firewallWhat are cryptography and digital signatureThe Threat of Malware and Cyber AttacksManagement of Linux Kernel and Loadable Kernel ModulesBash and python scripting...

In my work, I keep coming across networks and websites with significant security problems. In this book, I try to show the reader how easy it is to exploit security holes with various tools. Therefore, in my opinion, anyone who operates a network or a website should know to some extent how various hacking tools work to understand how to protect themselves against them. Many hackers don't even despise small home networks. Even if the topic is very technical, I will try to explain the concepts in a generally comprehensible form. A degree in computer science is by no means necessary to follow this book. Nevertheless, I don't just want to explain the operation of various tools, I also want to explain how they work in such a way that it becomes clear to you how the tool works and why a certain attack works.

This is Microsoft, and its Windows Apple and its Mac OS Linux and Linux distributions (the most popular is Ubuntu). Note that the first two systems are paid software and their price starts from a few hundred dollars. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, Linux distributions are completely free. In addition to pricing, Linux also benefits from system security and stability. All of us have heard stories that a dangerous virus has appeared on the network, which can delete all the data of Windows users. For UNIX systems, viruses are practically non-existent. Downloading from the Internet or ordering a free disk with the Ubuntu distribution, you will receive a fully-fledged operating system. You will not need to download additional software: all the basic applications required for the average user are already included in the Ubuntu package. All this said and done, what comes into the spotlight is the job profile of a Linux system administrator. There is a huge demand for this profile in all the major organizations worldwide, which work on Linux systems. This guide will focus on the following: What are Linux Distributions?What is Linux and Why Choose Linux?The Basic Components of LinuxLinux ApplicationsThe Linux DesktopBasic Administration and SecurityUsing the ShellWorking with LinksDiscerning CommandsLinux Text EditorsThe I/O RedirectionFile ManipulationsAnd more!If you are thinking that this is too difficult to understand, you will be surprised when you read how easily all the concepts are explained.You will be taken by the hand and guided, step by step, from the understanding of the most basic concepts to the most advanced ones.This is certainly the best guide to getting started on the market.""This book is a real gold mine.

While it all might seem incredibly overwhelming, give yourself some credit: learning anything new comes with learning new words, new concepts, and new pieces of information to work with. Currently, the user of a personal computer has a wide range of operating systems. Leading software manufacturers have made sure that the end user gets the most loyal and convenient way to work with a personal computer. Until recently, it was believed that Linux-based operating systems were quite difficult to manage and are suitable only for ""confident"" users. Is it so? We should start with the fact that now on the market there are three of the largest companies developing software. This is Microsoft, and its Windows Apple and its Mac OS Linux and Linux distributions (the most popular is Ubuntu). Note that the first two systems are paid software and their price starts from a few hundred dollars. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, Linux distributions are completely free. In addition to pricing, Linux also benefits from system security and stability. All of us have heard stories that a dangerous virus has appeared on the network, which can delete all the data of Windows users. For UNIX systems, viruses are practically non-existent. Downloading from the Internet or ordering a free disk with the Ubuntu distribution, you will receive a fully-fledged operating system. You will not need to download additional software: all the basic applications required for the average user are already included in the Ubuntu package. All this said and done, what comes into the spotlight is the job profile of a Linux system administrator. There is a huge demand for this profile in all the major organizations worldwide, which work on Linux systems. This guide will focus on the following: What are Linux Distributions?What is Linux and Why Choose Linux?The Basic Components of LinuxLinux ApplicationsThe Linux DesktopBasic Administration and SecurityUsing the ShellWorking with LinksDiscerning CommandsLinux Text EditorsThe I/O RedirectionFile ManipulationsAnd more!If you are thinking that this is too difficult to understand, you will be surprised when you read how easily all the concepts are explained.You will be taken by the hand and guided, step by step, from the understanding of the most basic concepts to the most advanced ones.This is certainly the best guide to getting started on the market.""This book is a real gold mine.

Die Entwicklung von GNU/ Linux stellt die soziologische Theorie der Kollektivg羹ter vor ein R瓣tsel: in einer gro?en, weitgehend anonymen Gruppe von Entwicklern und Nutzern wird ein Kollektivgut von h繹chstem Wert ge-schaffen: das Betriebsystem GNU/ Linux - f羹r jeden frei zug瓣nglich, anpassbar und zu verbreiten. Wie kommt es auf freiwilliger Basis zur Entwicklung eines qualitativ hochwertigen Kollektivgutes, wie des Betriebssystems GNU/ Linux, von dessen Nutzung niemand ausgeschlossen werden kann? Wie sieht die Entwicklungsweise aus, die zur erfolgreichen Bereitstellung des Be-triebs-sys-tems Linux 羹ber das Internet, f羹hrt? Der Entwicklungsprozess von Linux un-terscheidet sich fundamental von der industriellen Entwicklung propriet瓣rer Software. Dem Entwicklungsprozess fehlen die klassischen Ko-or-di-na-ti-ons-me-chansimen, wie Zeit- und Baupl瓣ne, die als entscheidend gelten, um Software zu entwickeln. Die Autorin Silvia Frank geht der Entwicklungsweise von Linux nach und zeigt auf, durch welche Faktoren es zur erfolgreichen Bereitstellung eines Kollektivguts, auch in gro?en, anonymen Gemeinschaften kommen kann. Das Buch richtet sich an Soziologen, Wirtschaftsinformatiker und Pro-jektmanager.

Revision with unchanged content. Network management is essential for the operation and supervision of me-dium to large computer networks. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the standard protocol for network management in the Internet. Or-di-nary SNMP agents are mostly monolithic, run in the user-space and often poll information from the OS kernel. This book examines to what extent the IETF standard sub-agent protocol AgentX is suitable for the management of UNIX/Linux kernel components. For this purpose, AgentX sub-agents have been implemented inside the kernel subsystem they manage. They use the AgentX protocol for communication with a master agent in user-space. With this approach, kernel subsystems can be managed in an efficient and com-pre-hen-sive way. The author describes the general design of this new in-kernel manage-ment architecture and its interface to the user-space. As an example, two kernel sub-systems, namely the network interfaces and Linux Netfilter, are implemented as MIB modules and explained. This book is intended for software developers of network and system ma-nage-ment solutions as well as researchers in this area.

LINUX is better than Windows. Some of the reasons mentioned here are: open source nature, secure, can revive older computers, perfect for programmers. Linux supports almost all of the major programming languages (Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, Ruby etc.). Moreover it offers a vast range of applications useful for programming purposes. The Linux terminal is superior to use over Window's command line for developers. You would find many libraries developed natively for Linux. Also, a lot of programmers point out that the package manager on Linux helps them get things done easily. Interestingly, the ability of bash scripting is also one of the most compelling reasons why programmers prefer using Linux Operating system. In this book, basic Linux commands, utilities and simple scripting programming is covered in chapter 1. Files and directories in Linux, process, signals are discussed in chapter 2 and chapter 3.

It is common these days for a single system to host many domains. A system usually has a canonical domain, it has its usual or local domain name, and additional domains are configured as virtual domains. The purpose behind this work is to create a mail server solution based on Postfix that is based on virtual users and domains. The goal is to have completely virtual users and domains. This means creating a separate name spaces for reach domain. It will also demonstrate the installation and configuration of Courier-Imap (IMAP/POP3), so it can authenticate against the same MySQL database Postfix uses. The resulting postfix server is capable of quota which is not built into Postfix by default; the project will demonstrate how to patch postfix appropriately. Passwords are stored in encrypted form in the database. The work also covers the installation of Mail Scanner, SpamAssassin and ClamAv so that emails will be scanned for spams and viruses. The administration of MySQL database can be done through a web based tool Postfixadmin or can be done manually in the MySQL shell. Postfixadmin is a web based management tool created for Postfix that handles Postfix style virtual domains and users that are stored in MySQL. The squirrelmail web based email client is installed, in order to check emails from anywhere in world via internet. All installations were done in Fedora 5 Linux machine.

All computer systems can suffer from malware, ransomware, rootkit and viruses, including Linux and BSD OS. Thankfully, very few viruses exist for Linux, so users typically do not install antivirus software. It is still recommended that Linux users have antivirus software installed on Linux systems that are on a network or that have files being transferred to the device. Some users may argue that antivirus software uses up too much resources. Thankfully, low-footprint software exists for Linux. To better understand antivirus programs, it may be beneficial to understand malware itself. If you are running a SME business with a number of workstations, it might be a good idea to install an antivirus on the central computer that manages all the emails, data and traffic in your company. The best way to protect a system against viruses is to only download and install software from trusted sites and developers. With the discontinuation of AVG Antivirus for Linux and the lack of security suite from big players such as Symantec Norton or Intel McAfee, Linux are left with a few choices when it comes to OS security. Linux users are generally free from virus attack but bugs that enables a hacker to take over your linux system is out there, thus an antivirus with a good firewall is a must for your Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Bodhi, Elementary, Fedora, CentOS and more.

The paper concerns about basic Microsoft ISA server and Linux Squid Server configuration As a lot of technicians switch between ISA server and Squid server, I decided to write this paper to present some reference when configuring ISA and Squid. There a lot of issues that not covered, and you can go to the manual of ISA server and Squid server for detailed configuration of ISA and Squid. The paper is composed from two parts 1.Microsoft ISA server 2004 Configuration 2.Linux Squid Server Configuration Note that, this work was done without proper simulation, because of the lack of resources, as testing firewall configuration requires many computers, with one of them should have many network cards. Also the ISA server is not used in the computer center now.

Free Opensource Antivirus Dan Anti Malware Software Untuk Sistem Operasi Ubuntu Linux Dalam Bahasa Inggris Standar Version. All computer systems can suffer from malware, ransomware, trojan, rootkit and viruses, including Linux, Mac and BSD OS. Thankfully, very few viruses exist for Linux, so users typically do not install antivirus software. It is still recommended that Linux users have antivirus software installed on Linux systems that are on a network or that have files being transferred to the device. Some users may argue that antivirus software uses up too much resources. Thankfully, low-footprint software exists for Linux. To better understand antivirus programs, it may be beneficial to understand malware itself. If you are running a SME business with a number of workstations, it might be a good idea to install an antivirus on the central computer that manages all the emails, data and traffic in your company. The best way to protect a system against viruses is to only download and install software from trusted sites and developers. With the discontinuation of AVG Antivirus for Linux and the lack of security suite from big players such as Symantec Norton or Intel McAfee, Linux are left with a few choices when it comes to OS security. Linux users are generally free from virus attack but bugs that enables a hacker to take over your linux system is out there, thus an antivirus with a good firewall is a must for your Ubuntu, Mint, Debian and Other Linux OS.

You've experienced the shiny, point-and-click surface of your Linux computer--now dive below and explore its depths with the power of the command line. The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell (or command line). Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of experienced, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book's short, easily-digestible chapters, you'll learn how to:  - Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks - Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management - Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines - Edit files with Vi, the world's most popular text editor - Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks - Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial ""shell shock,"" you'll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don't be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust.

Linux is a powerful open-source operating system that has been around for many years and is widely used for running servers and websites. But most students and Makers encounter it for the first time when they are working on projects with their Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computers (SBCs) such as BeagleBone Black or Intel Galileo. Linux for Makers is the first book that explains the Linux operating system specifically for Makers, as opposed to programmers and administrators. By gaining a deeper understanding of Linux, Makers can add another useful tool to their kit that will help them build their projects more easily.Written with the Maker in mind, this book will focus mostly on Rasbian running on the Raspberry Pi as it is the most prolific in the ecosystem today. However most of the topics covered will apply broadly to other Linux distributions and will be called out when they may differ. Many times users cut and paste from a website tutorial into the Linux command line without understanding what they are actually doing only to be frustrated when they want to modify or tweak something to suit their needs. Also, many Makers shy away from using the Raspberry Pi or similar board because they feel Linux is too foreign and they think using a command line will be more difficult than using a GUI. This book aims to overcome those fears and provide a foundation for further learning and exploration. To that end, this book will focus on the basic principles that a Maker would need to know as opposed to other resources that go into detail that is not particularly relevant to building projects.

Unlike some operating systems, Linux doesn't try to hide the important bits from you--it gives you full control of your computer. But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does. In this completely revised second edition of the perennial best seller How Linux Works, author Brian Ward makes the concepts behind Linux internals accessible to anyone curious about the inner workings of the operating system. Inside, you'll find the kind of knowledge that normally comes from years of experience doing things the hard way. You'll learn: -How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init implementations (systemd, Upstart, and System V)-How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processes-How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers work-How development tools work and relate to shared libraries-How to write effective shell scripts You'll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user space, including system calls, input and output, and filesystems. With its combination of background, theory, real-world examples, and patient explanations, How Linux Works will teach you what you need to know to solve pesky problems and take control of your operating system.

	■ 專業的破解駭客，是不可能用Windows這種作業系統的。雖然使用Linux，還是得自己下載不同的工具。有沒有一個Linux，把所有這樣的專業工具都集合了呢？

	■ Kali Linux正是大家朝思暮想的distro。集合最好用的破解工具，nmap、maltego、sqlmap、hydra、wpscan等，更有好用的 wireshark、metasploit，以及利用NVIDIA CUDA的pyrit等，數百個專業駭客的專用工具大集合，怎能不心動！

	Kali Linux 的前身為網路安全業界知名的BackTrack。Kali Linux 整合了巨量的滲透測試工具，如nmap、Wireshark、John the Ripper 和Airecrack-ng 等。

	滲透測試是透過模擬惡意駭客的攻擊方法，來評估電腦網路系統安全的一種評估方法。這個過程包含對系統的任何弱點、技術缺陷或漏洞的主動分析。這個分析是從一個攻擊者可能存在的角色來進行的，並且從這個角色有條件主動利用安全性漏洞。

	本書選取了Kali Linux 最核心和最基礎的內容進行說明，讓讀者能夠掌握滲透測試的流程，並使用Wireshark 工具，透過分析捕捉的資料封包，詳細介紹攻擊的實現方式。學習完本書後，讀者應該可以具備獨立進行一些基本滲透測試的能力。

適用：Linux 初學者、想成為安全滲透測試人員、 網路系統管理員、專業的安全滲透測試人員、需要一本必備手冊的程式設計師

本書結構

第1 篇 Linux 安全滲透測試基礎（第1 ∼ 3 章）
	主要內容包含：Linux 安全滲透簡介、設定Kali Linux 和進階測試實驗室。透過本篇的學習，讀者可以了解安全滲透測試的概念及所需的工具、在各種裝置上安裝Kali Linux 作業系統、設定目標系統等。

第2 篇 資訊的收集及利用（第4 ∼ 6 章）
	主要內容包含：資訊收集、漏洞掃描和漏洞利用等。透過本篇的學習，讀者可以收集大量目標主機的資訊、掃描目標主機存在的漏洞及利用這些漏洞，為後續滲透攻擊做好準備。

第3 篇 各種滲透測試（第7 ∼ 9 章）
	主要內容包含：提升使用者許可權、密碼攻擊和無線網路滲透測試等。透過本篇的學習，讀者可以透過提升自己的許可權，實現各種密碼攻擊，如取得目標主機上各種服務的使用者名稱、密碼和無線網路的登入密碼等。

學習建議

	◎掌握基本的網路通訊協定。通常攻擊目標主機，需要了解其存在的漏洞或開放的通訊埠，但是這些通訊埠都對應有一個網路通訊協定，了解對應的網路通訊協定和工作機制，可以更進一步地收集資訊和尋找漏洞。

	◎一定要有耐心。滲透測試常常需要花費大量的時間，例如在破解密碼時，如果沒有一個很好的密碼字典，會需要幾個小時、甚至幾天的時間。或要抓取理想的資料封包，常常需要長時間的等待，然後從巨量資料封包中尋找需要的資訊。

本書適合讀者群

	Linux 初學者、想成為安全滲透測試人員、 滲透測試興趣同好、網路系統管理員、專業的安全滲透測試人員、大專院校的學生、社會教育訓練班學員、 需要一本案頭必備手冊的程式設計師。

本書作者

	本書主要由蘭州文理學院電子資訊工程學院的楊波主筆撰寫。其他參與撰寫者為魏星、吳寶生、伍遠明、謝平、頊宇峰、徐楚輝、閆常友、陽麟、楊紀梅、楊松梅、余月、張廣龍、張亮、張曉輝、張雪華、趙海波、趙偉、周成、朱森。

	閱讀本書的過程中若有任何疑問，都可以發郵件或在討論區和QQ 群裡提問，最後順祝各位讀者閱讀愉快！

本書特色

1. 以最新為基礎的滲透測試系統Kali Linux
	BackTrack 曾是安全領域最知名的測試專用Linux 系統，但是由於其已經停止更新，而全面轉向Kali Linux，所以Kali 將成為安全人士的不二選擇。本書以Kali Linux 來展現滲透測試為基礎的各項內容。

2. 內容難度適當
	本書介紹Linux 安全滲透測試的基礎知識及作業系統、網路通訊協定、社交工程工具組等諸多領域，最後還詳細介紹各種滲透測試無線網路。

3. 理論和操作結合說明
	本書沒有枯燥的羅列理論，也沒有一味的說明操作，而是將兩者結合起來，讓讀者明白測試所基於的理論，以及從中衍生出的測試攻擊方法。這樣，讀者可以更清楚地掌握書中的內容。

4. 更直觀的說明方式

這是一本介紹協定核心實現原始程式碼的書，不是介紹“協定”的書。本書作者做過一些網路通信產品開發，所以對網路內部實現很感興趣，於是在學習和工作時間之餘記錄下分析和調用Linux 的網路通訊協定核心的心得體會。很多人對網路非常感興趣，但卻不理解內部是如何運作的，或知之不多，最終的結果就是行之不遠。本書嘗試用淺顯的語言和合理的安排帶領讀者到Linux 核心網路模組的程式碼叢林中一遊，既讓你有所知，也讓您有所思。Linux 是經過成千上萬用戶使用過並且還將不斷發展的，目前Linux 在伺服器市場上已經證明其設計的精巧和健壯，特別是當核心也從非搶佔式發展成為搶佔式後，嵌入設備市場上也將要掀起一股風浪。於是Linux 核心分析的資料層出不窮，但有的太老（核心的程式碼還使用2.2 的），有的對網路部分的分析不甚詳細，因此作者萌發了分析整個Linux 網路通訊協定核心的想法。希望能在研究一些經典程式碼時發現與時俱進的部分，?磚引玉，吸引更多的人參與到研究網路通訊協定核心的實現技巧以及移植工作上，而不用對照枯燥的RFC 文件和程式碼。

Kernel 就是 OS 的核心。OS 的基本功能都是由 kernel 提供的。建立檔案、傳送封包等動作都是以 kernel 的功能完成。不過建立這些功能並不是單純的工作。儘管平常不會意識到，裡面深藏了許多高階技術。以檔案系統來說，或許會在放置檔案的時候考慮到極力減少磁碟搜尋動作，以網路的部份來說，或許會為路由表項目數龐大的情形做好準備，使得這種情形不會對系統整體造成太大的影響。記憶體管理、process 管理等部份也暗藏了各式各樣的技巧。看懂這些高階技術，正是 kernel hacking 的魅力之一。 不過最近的 Linux kernel 不再只提供基本的功能。隨著功能進化，它不斷實作了為某些領域特化的方便功能、還有許多獨特的功能。就算是 kernel hacker 應該也很少人能全部掌握吧。 本書將從進化至今的 Linux kernel 多數功能之中，選定許多人需要的、或是很有意思的功能，在說明這些工能的過程中，一併解釋內部的運作機制。同時也會討論到善用這些功能所需的工具與設定方法、調整技巧。 「節能」是本書會討論到的主題之一。不僅會說明使用方式，還會談到節能的思考方向、以及它與硬體的關聯。另外也會涵蓋最近受到注目的虛擬化、資源管理、納入標準檔案系統之一的 ext4 等等，廣泛涵蓋各種經典功能與新功能。經典功能的部份會盡可能調查最新的原始碼，討論變更點與新增功能。這部份是文件找不到、不探索 kernel 內部就無法得知的資訊，所以就算已經知道這些功能的讀者，或許也會有新發現。另外本書也會介紹與 kernel 有關的工具，其中包含 gcore 這個對重要的系統來說十分需要的工具。 最新的 Linux kernel 實作了強力的追蹤 (trace)、效能量測 (profiling) 功能。用起來很方便，也提供許多功能。不僅能勝任原先的目的，在 kernel hacking 的時候也大有幫助。對 kernel hacker 老手來說，應該也有參考價值。 本書包含許多在現場也能立刻派上用場的完整實例。如果讀者想完整發揮 kernel 功能的話，本書應該十分具有參考價值。

這本書，您可以把它當成一本核心原始程式分析的書，甚至僅僅當成核心USB 實現原始程式分析的書，但是我更希望您把它當成展現如何研究Linux核心，展現如何與核心進行平等交流的一個範例，起碼它表現了應該用什麼樣的態度去對待Linux 核心原始程式。也就是說，分析核心原始程式，態度決定一切。很多人或許有這樣的困惑，也分析瀏覽了很多核心的原始程式，可總是覺得分析、瀏覽後，腦子裡還是空空的，並沒有感覺到多大的收穫。這個時候或許可以去看看是不是自己在分析程式時的態度出現了問題。在分析核心原始程式時，只有遵循嚴謹的態度，而非抱著走馬看花、得過且過的態度，最終才會有很大的收穫。

Introduction Linux applies an alternate philosophy to computing that revolves around the sharing of not only software but also knowledge. To use Linux is to become part of a huge global community of people who have caught on to a phenomenon that is changing the world. Ubuntu (http: //www.ubuntu.com) is the natural continuation of these goals. It's a project founded by entrepreneur businessman Mark Shuttleworth with the intention of bringing a freely available, high-quality operating system to the world. To this end, Shuttleworth invested $10 million of his own money to guarantee that this will be the case for many years to come. In 2010, the project has moved closer to becoming self-sustaining as Ubuntu becomes part of the mainstream for desktop, Netbook, and server users. The fundamental concept is that Ubuntu is available for use by anyone in the world, no matter who or where they are. As such, many different languages are supported, and the operating system can also be accessed by those with disabilities, such as partial sight or hearing. Ubuntu might just as easily be found on a Wall Street banker's laptop as on a battered old computer in a Brazilian favela.

The Linux Programming Interface (TLPI) is the definitive guide to the Linux and UNIX programming interface--the interface employed by nearly every application that runs on a Linux or UNIX system. In this authoritative work, Linux programming expert Michael Kerrisk provides detailed descriptions of the system calls and library functions that you need in order to master the craft of system programming, and accompanies his explanations with clear, complete example programs. You'll find descriptions of over 500 system calls and library functions, and more than 200 example programs, 88 tables, and 115 diagrams. You'll learn how to: -Read and write files efficiently-Use signals, clocks, and timers-Create processes and execute programs-Write secure programs-Write multithreaded programs using POSIX threads-Build and use shared libraries-Perform interprocess communication using pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores-Write network applications with the sockets API While The Linux Programming Interface covers a wealth of Linux-specific features, including epoll, inotify, and the /proc file system, its emphasis on UNIX standards (POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3 and POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4) makes it equally valuable to programmers working on other UNIX platforms. The Linux Programming Interface is the most comprehensive single-volume work on the Linux and UNIX programming interface, and a book that's destined to become a new classic.

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) technology is becoming a standard feature of computer systems that support mission-critical services like file sharing, mail exchange, or Web servers. RAID offers two benefits to these essential systems: improved I/O performance and fail-safe data storage.Although bandwidth problems on networks are well documented, the internal data transfer bottleneck that exists at the hardware level in each system can also leave you with perplexing performance issues. RAID is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage way to alleviate this bandwidth problem by distributing the I/O load seamlessly across multiple disks and controllers.RAID also provides uninterrupted data access through disk mirroring and parity algorithms. That means systems can remain online even during a disk or controller failure. RAID is scalable, making it robust enough for large, high-traffic sites and small, critical systems. By using RAID, system administrators can combine single disks into terabytes worth of data storage.Managing RAID on Linux covers everything system administrators need to know to put together a system that can support RAID. You will learn about the different types of RAID, along with associated technologies and issues, and how to choose the best RAID system for your needs. With a step-by-step, hands-on approach, the author guides you through the installation of either Linux software RAID or a hardware RAID card. The book shows how to build an array and optionally install a high-performance file system. Contents include: An introduction to RAID and LinuxPlanning and architecture of your RAID systemBuilding a software RAIDSoftware RAID tools and referencesBuilding a hardware RAIDPerformance and tuning of your RAID systemRAID has become the low-cost solution of choice to deal with the ever-increasing demand for data storage space. Written for system administrators, power users, tech managers, and anyone who wants to learn about RAID technology, Managing RAID on Linux sidesteps the often-confusing vendor-specific approach you'll find elsewhere to give you the straight story on RAID. Even non-Linux users will find this book full of valuable material.

Introduction Community Enterprise Operating System, or CentOS, is an enterprise Linux distribution. It was developed by the CentOS Project community using the source code of the commercial Linux distribution from Redhat, the Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). They created CentOS to have a free alternative to RHEL and to have a Linux distribution that's as stable as its commercial counterpart and can keep up with the requirements of the enterprise. Using CentOS is a good choice to learn Linux not only for its RHEL roots but also for its compatibility, quality, and support. CentOS is binary compatible with the RHEL because it was built using the source code of RHEL. Also, the developers made sure to adhere to the redistribution rules of RHEL when they built CentOS so it would be a truly free alternative to the original. CentOS is continuously being developed by its core developers and its community. They make security and software updates and quality assurance measures to maintain the stability of the distribution. The packages they build for CentOS are placed on their distributed mirror network to allow users to download and install software on their system manually if needed. Because of the core developers and its community, CentOS is able to have a constant release upgrade schedule to allow users to use new software and to support new hardware. They are also increasing in numbers, and that means there's always a better CentOS after each release.

This book is for anyone who wants to master Linux from the command line. When writing it, I had in mind system administrators, software developers, and enthusiastic users who want to get things going from the Linux command line. For beginning users, this may be a daunting task, as Linux commands often have many options documented only in pages that are not that easy to understand. This book is distribution agnostic. That is, while writing it, I've checked all items against Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE. Since most distributions are quite similar to one of these three, this book should help you with other distributions as well. There is only one item in the book that is not distribution agnostic: the Appendix, which explains how to install OpenSUSE. I've chosen to cover installation of just one distribution, because if you don't have any Linux installed yet, you probably don't care what you install. If you do care what distribution to work with, you probably have it installed already.

了解安裝步驟安裝分為安裝前、安裝中、與安裝後三大程序。在這邊將透過安裝來說明每個畫面的步驟以及之後章節的對應，對於想更進一步了解安裝步驟的讀者而言，這是值得一讀的主題。程序與訊號所有的程式在系統中都以程序的方式呈現。這主題中將會介紹程序、訊號、以及內部程序的溝通。檔案系統有句話說：“在Linux中的所有東西都是檔案”。不論軟硬體在Linux中都以檔案的方式呈現。在本書將從硬碟分割開始，到檔案系統的產生，最後掛接在目錄下並可讓我們存取資料。swap、/proc、ram file system這三者是Linux下特殊的檔案系統，分別做為虛擬記憶體與核心目錄。管理帳號與群組帳號是Linux相當重要的一環，所有的權限設定都圍繞著帳號而定。此外，大部分的服務都是以特定的使用者來執行，因此，管理使用者與群組成為管理者必備的功課之一。RPM與YUM的管理RPM與YUM是Fedora上的套件管理工具，所有的軟體安裝、升級、與移除，幾乎都透過這兩者來處理，因此這是必須熟讀主題。其他軟體安裝方式除了RPM與YUM，還會使用的安裝方式包括原始檔與二進位檔安裝。紀錄檔設定正確以及分類過的紀錄可讓我們快速的閱讀記錄，並發現問題的所在，在這個主題下，讀者必須先對時間的設定與紀錄的格式有所了解，進而編寫自己的紀錄檔。系統資源控管對於一台多人使用的主機，系統資源的管控顯得十分的重要，如何針對使用者限制可使用的資源，成為十分重要的課題之一。這邊的資源包含CPU、RAM、硬碟等等。入侵手法介紹本主題介紹常見的入侵手法，包含非技術性的入侵案例、單人模式與救援模式的登入、以及入侵方式的分類介紹。iptables這是Linux下最強的防火牆軟體，有封包過濾、轉向、與重組的強大功能，並且是NAT伺服器必備的工具。網路資源控管／安全設定／防火牆設定對於網路資源的控管，基本上的以分為兩大類：一者為權限控管，也就是哪些來源以及目的地可以被本機或是同網路下的機器所存取，此外我們可以針對port以及網路卡卡號來做限制﹔另一者為品質控管，也就是針對不同的連線端限制不同的流量。遠方主機管理使用Linux的好處之一，就是不需要坐在主機前面，而可以在遠端透過網路連線控管，控管的方式包括ssh與Webmin。網域名稱伺服器（DNS server）在這主題下，必須先了解網路相關設定，再透過第16章了解DNS申請與架設的過程，以及DNS的進階應用。網站伺服器（Web server）所謂的網站伺服器，是透過HTTP讓使用者可以對伺服器上的資料進行瀏覽，在這邊將介紹最有名的網站伺服器軟體apache。對於網頁伺服器，有需多功能必須搭配DNS伺服器方有效果，因此建議讀的章節包含網路的設定、DNS伺服器的架設，與apache的設定。郵件伺服器（Mail server）在Linux上，我們可以透過sendmail或postfix的郵件伺服器來達到收發郵件的功能，但作為郵件伺服器，必須與DNS伺服器搭配方能顯示出效果，因此在這主題下，建議先對網路設定與DNS的設定有初步的了解，再了解sendmail或postfix的相關使用方式。OpenWebMailOpwnWebMail是Linux上結合郵件伺服器與網站伺服器的收發信軟體，在這主題下需了解網路設定、服務器設定、網站與郵件伺服器的操作。檔案傳輸伺服器（FTP server）FTP server是目前快速且方便的檔案傳輸伺服器，在這主題下首先需了解網路相關設定，再了解vsftp的設定與使用方式。檔案伺服器（File server）在這邊的檔案伺服器，包含對UNIX/Linux的NFS以及對Windows的samba介紹。本書特色Linux的歷史與Red Hat到Fedora的大事記開機過程與程序介紹USB的安裝說明伺服器架構介紹Live CD使用說明VPN伺服器與用戶端的設定郵件用戶端與伺服器端的對應設定OpenWebMail在SELinux下的設定從帳號、權限到程序的設定與管理系統預設的目錄介紹與檔案系統管理SELinux與各伺服器的搭配應用套件的安裝、升級與移除FTP、Samba、與NFS伺服器的設定NAT的設定、權限、與流量管控網域名稱DNS伺服器的申請與管理郵件伺服器sendmail與postfix的設定與範例網站伺服器Apache的應用與權限設定入侵掃描、系統安全設定、與防火牆管理

The system administrator is one of the users of a system, and something more. The administrator wears many hats, as knowledgeable user of UNIX commands, as an operator of system hardware, and as a problem solver. The administrator is also called upon to be an arbitrator in human affairs. A multiuser computer is like a vast imaginary space where many people work and utilize the resources found there. The administrator must be the village elder in this space and settle the disputes that may arise with, hopefully, the wisdom of Solomon. --Rebecca Thomas and Rik Farrow (UNIX Administration Guide for System V, Pearson PTR, 1989) We find it interesting how little UNIX system administration has changed in the last twenty years. If you substitute ""computer network"" for ""multiuser computer,"" this description still fits perfectly. The main difference in UNIX system administration between 1989 and 2008 (besides ubiquitous networking) is the sheer number of systems that the average system adm- istrator deals with. Automation is the primary tool to deal with the chaos that can result from so many systems. With it, you can deploy systems identically every time, restore s- tems to a known good state, and implement changes reliably across all systems (or only an appropriate subset).

You will find recipes for: Building a gateway, firewall, and wireless access point on a Linux network Building a VoIP server with Asterisk Secure remote administration with SSH Building secure VPNs with OpenVPN, and a Linux PPTP VPN server Single sign-on with Samba for mixed Linux/Windows LANs Centralized network directory with OpenLDAP Network monitoring with Nagios or MRTG Getting acquainted with IPv6 Setting up hands-free networks installations of new systems Linux system administration via serial console And a lot more. Each recipe includes a clear, hands-on solution with tested code, plus a discussion on why it works. When you need to solve a network problem without delay, and don't have the time or patience to comb through reference books or the Web for answers, Linux Networking Cookbook gives you exactly what you need.

If you're an experienced system administrator looking to acquire Linux skills, or a seasoned Linux user facing a new challenge, Linux System Administration offers practical knowledge for managing a complete range of Linux systems and servers. The book summarizes the steps you need to build everything from standalone SOHO hubs, web servers, and LAN servers to load-balanced clusters and servers consolidated through virtualization. Along the way, you'll learn about all of the tools you need to set up and maintain these working environments.  Linux is now a standard corporate platform with users numbering in the hundreds of millions, and there is a definite shortage of talented administrators. Linux System Administration is ideal as an introduction to Linux for Unix veterans, MCSEs, and mainframe administrators, and as an advanced (and refresher) guide for existing Linux administrators who will want to jump into the middle of the book. Inside, you'll learn how to:  Set up a stand-alone Linux server Install, configure, maintain, and troubleshoot a DNS server using BIND Build an Internet server to manage sites, perform email and file transfers, and more Set up an email service for a small-to-medium-sized site, complete with authentication Install and configure Apache, PHP, and MySQL on a web server built from scratch Combine computers into a load-balanced Apache web server cluster based on the free Linux Virtual Server Set up local network services from distributed file systems to DHCP services, gateway services, print services, user management and more Use Linux virtualization with Xen or VMWare to run multiple kernels on one piece of hardware; manage each kernel's access to processor time, devices, and memory Create shell scripts and adapt them for your own needs Back up and restore data with rsync, tar, cdrecord, Amanda, and MySQL tools  Linux System Administration is not only knowledgeable and practical, but convenient. The ingredients for this book had been scattered throughout mailing lists, forums, and discussion groups, as well as books, periodicals, and the experiences of colleagues.

This unique and valuable collection of tips, tools, and scripts provides clear, concise, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing anyone running a network of Linux servers from small networks to large data centers in the practical and popular problem-solution-discussion O'Reilly cookbook format.The Linux Cookbook covers everything you'd expect: backups, new users, and the like. But it also covers the non-obvious information that is often ignored in other books the time-sinks and headaches that are a real part of an administrator's job, such as: dealing with odd kinds of devices that Linux historically hasn't supported well, building multi-boot systems, and handling things like video and audio.The knowledge needed to install, deploy, and maintain Linux is not easily found, and no Linux distribution gets it just right. Scattered information can be found in a pile of man pages, texinfo files, and source code comments, but the best source of information is the experts themselves who built up a working knowledge of managing Linux systems. This cookbook's proven techniques distill years of hard-won experience into practical cut-and-paste solutions to everyday Linux dilemmas.Use just one recipe from this varied collection of real-world solutions, and the hours of tedious trial-and-error saved will more than pay for the cost of the book. But those who prefer to learn hands-on will find that this cookbook not only solves immediate problems quickly, it also cuts right to the chase pointing out potential pitfalls and illustrating tested practices that can be applied to a myriad of other situations.Whether you're responsible for a small Linux system, a huge corporate system, or a mixed Linux/Windows/MacOS network, you'll find valuable, to-the-point, practical recipes for dealing with Linux systems everyday. The Linux Cookbook is more than a time-saver; it's a sanity saver.

Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.Robotics is becoming an increasingly popular field for hobbyists and professionals alike The cost of the mechanics and electronics required to build a robot are low enough that almost anybody can afford it. The hardware that used to require government funding or a large university is now available to the average person. At the same time, programming is becoming a more common skill. This book combines the most sophisticated parts of robotics and programming to fill a real gap in available information.Most robotics books today use microcontrollers as the ""brains"" of the robots. This approach is fine for smaller, less expensive projects, but has serious limitations. When attempting to build a robot with sophisticated movements, navigation abilities, vision, and picture-capturing abilities, it is better to use a single board computer (SBC) such as Linux as the controller.

Linux consistently appears high up in the list of popular Internet servers, whether it's for the Web, anonymous FTP, or general services such as DNS and delivering mail. But security is the foremost concern of anyone providing such a service. Any server experiences casual probe attempts dozens of time a day, and serious break-in attempts with some frequency as well. This highly regarded book, originally titled Building Secure Servers with Linux, combines practical advice with a firm knowledge of the technical tools needed to ensure security. The book focuses on the most common use of Linux--as a hub offering services to an organization or the Internet--and shows readers how to harden their hosts against attacks. An all-inclusive resource for Linux users who wish to harden their systems, Linux Server Security covers general security such as intrusion detection and firewalling a hub, as well as key services such as DNS, the Apache Web server, mail, and secure shell. Author Michael D. Bauer, a security consultant, network architect, and lead author of the popular Paranoid Penguin column in the Linux Journal, carefully outlines the security risks, defines precautions that can minimize those risks, and offers recipes for robust security. He is joined on several chapters by administrator and developer Bill Lubanovic. A number of new security topics have been added for this edition, including: Database security, with a focus on MySQL Using OpenLDAP for authentication An introduction to email encryption The Cyrus IMAP service, a popular mail delivery agent The vsftpd FTP server Geared toward Linux users with little security expertise, the author explains security concepts and techniques in clear language, beginning with the fundamentals. Linux Server Security with Linux provides a unique balance of ""big picture"" principles that transcend specific software packages and version numbers, and very clear procedures on securing some of those software packages on several popular distributions. With this book in hand, you'll have both the expertise and the tools to comprehensively secure your Linux system.

If you've ever wondered how Linux carries out the complicated tasks assigned to it by the IP protocols -- or if you just want to learn about modern networking through real-life examples -- Understanding Linux Network Internals is for you.  Like the popular O'Reilly book, Understanding the Linux Kernel, this book clearly explains the underlying concepts and teaches you how to follow the actual C code that implements it. Although some background in the TCP/IP protocols is helpful, you can learn a great deal from this text about the protocols themselves and their uses. And if you already have a base knowledge of C, you can use the book's code walkthroughs to figure out exactly what this sophisticated part of the Linux kernel is doing.  Part of the difficulty in understanding networks -- and implementing them -- is that the tasks are broken up and performed at many different times by different pieces of code. One of the strengths of this book is to integrate the pieces and reveal the relationships between far-flung functions and data structures. Understanding Linux Network Internals is both a big-picture discussion and a no-nonsense guide to the details of Linux networking. Topics include: Key problems with networking Network interface card (NIC) device drivers System initialization Layer 2 (link-layer) tasks and implementation Layer 3 (IPv4) tasks and implementation Neighbor infrastructure and protocols (ARP) Bridging Routing ICMP Author Christian Benvenuti, an operating system designer specializing in networking, explains much more than how Linux code works. He shows the purposes of major networking features and the trade-offs involved in choosing one solution over another. A large number of flowcharts and other diagrams enhance the book's understandability.

In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks.The third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics: Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended FilesystemsProcess creation and schedulingSignals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device driversTimingSynchronization within the kernelInterprocess Communication (IPC) Program executionUnderstanding the Linux Kernel will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.

To the outside world, a ""supercomputer"" appears to be a single system. In fact, it's a cluster of computers that share a local area network and have the ability to work together on a single problem as a team. Many businesses used to consider supercomputing beyond the reach of their budgets, but new Linux applications have made high-performance clusters more affordable than ever. These days, the promise of low-cost supercomputing is one of the main reasons many businesses choose Linux over other operating systems.  This new guide covers everything a newcomer to clustering will need to plan, build, and deploy a high-performance Linux cluster. The book focuses on clustering for high-performance computation, although much of its information also applies to clustering for high-availability (failover and disaster recovery). The book discusses the key tools you'll need to get started, including good practices to use while exploring the tools and growing a system. You'll learn about planning, hardware choices, bulk installation of Linux on multiple systems, and other basic considerations. Then, you'll learn about software options that can save you hours--or even weeks--of deployment time. Since a wide variety of options exist in each area of clustering software, the author discusses the pros and cons of the major free software projects and chooses those that are most likely to be helpful to new cluster administrators and programmers. A few of the projects introduced in the book include: MPI, the most popular programming library for clusters. This book offers simple but realistic introductory examples along with some pointers for advanced use.

  Praise for Building Clustered Linux Systems   ""The author does an outstanding job of presenting a very complicated subject. I very much commend this work. The author sets the pace and provides vital resources and tips along the way. He also has a very good sense of humor that is crafted in the text in such a way that makes the reading enjoyable just when the subject may demand a break. This book should be a requirement for those that are clustering or considering clustering and especially those considering investing a great deal of financial resource toward that goal."" -Joe Brazeal, Information Technician III, Southwest Power Pool ""This book is for Beginner and Intermediate level system administrators, engineers, and researchers, who want to learn how to build Linux clusters. The book covers everything very well."" -Ibrahim Haddad, Senior Researcher, Ericsson Corporate Unit of Research ""Nothing that I know of exists yet that covers this subject in as much depth and detail. The practical 'hands-on' approach of this book on how to build a Linux cluster makes this a very valuable reference for a very popular, highly demanded technology."" -George Vish, II, Linux Curriculum Program Manager and Senior Education Consultant, HP ""In my opinion there is a significant lack of literature on this subject. Most of the currently available books are either dated or do not address the complete picture of the range of decisions that must go into building a Linux cluster. I feel comfortable recommending this to anyone interested in building a Linux cluster to better understand both the technical aspects of building and designing a Linux cluster, but also the business aspects of the same."" -Randall Splinter Ph.D., Senior Solution Architect, HP ""The author has set a precedent in the cluster design and integration process that is lacking in the industry today."" --Stephen Gray, Senior Applications Engineer, Altair Engineering, Inc.  The Practical, Step-by-Step Guide to Building and Running Linux Clusters  Low-cost, high-performance Linux clusters are the best solution for an increasingly wide range of technical and business problems. Until now, however, building and managing Linux clusters has required more specialized knowledge than most IT organizations possess. This book dramatically lowers the learning curve, bringing together all the hands-on knowledge and step-by-step techniques you'll need to get the job done. Using practical examples, Robert Lucke simplifies every facet of cluster design and integration: networking, hardware, architecture, operating environments, data sharing, applications, and more. Lucke, who helped prototype and implement one of the world's largest Linux clusters, systematically addresses the key issues you'll encounter and the key decisions you'll have to make. Coverage includes:   Basic clustering concepts, hardware components, and architectural models   A step-by-step cluster creation process: design, installation, and testing   Choosing and implementing the optimal hardware configuration for your environment   Life in the fast LAN: high-speed cluster interconnects   Software issues: distributions, bootup, disks, partitioning, file systems, middleware, and more

Firewalls, Network Address Translation (NAT), network logging and accounting are all provided by Linux's Netfilter system, also known by the name of the command used to administer it, iptables. The iptables interface is the most sophisticated ever offered on Linux and makes Linux an extremely flexible system for any kind of network filtering you might do. Large sets of filtering rules can be grouped in ways that makes it easy to test them and turn them on and off. Do you watch for all types of ICMP traffic--some of them quite dangerous? Can you take advantage of stateful filtering to simplify the management of TCP connections? Would you like to track how much traffic of various types you get? This pocket reference will help you at those critical moments when someone asks you to open or close a port in a hurry, either to enable some important traffic or to block an attack. The book will keep the subtle syntax straight and help you remember all the values you have to enter in order to be as secure as possible. The book has an introductory section that describes applications, followed by a reference/encyclopaedic section with all the matches and targets arranged alphabetically.

防火牆是現今網路安全中最重要的一環，而Linux防火牆的功能更是其中的翹楚，但由於Linux防火牆過於精細的功能，使得一般人在入門時遇到極大的困難，再加上目前並沒有針對此一主題開發的專業書籍，因此本書可說是擔負了這個領域的先驅。為了達到量少而質精的目標，本書直接切入Linux防火牆的核心-iptables，而不浪費大量篇幅於原則性的討探，或是枯燥的安全性描述，這可使讀者更能掌握其中的重點。其次是實際範例的討論，在本書中的每個語法都直接配合對應的範例與說明，因此可降低學習時的困難度，也使實用性大大的提升。

As DEVELOPERS, WE FIND ourselves challenged by the ubiquity of the Internet on a daily basis as we often need or want to provide some level of network service within our applications. Whether our goal is to allow remote monitoring of an application's health, enable multiple users to access a centralized service, or even authenticate a user's identity prior to giving him access to an application, network programming is a seemingly dark art practiced by only the most experi- enced developers. We have written this text to help you meet the challenge, and to show you that network programming can be both enjoyable and easy to learn. From exploring the basics of networking, to creating complex multithreaded servers, to securing network communications, we present you with precise defi- nitions, clear explanations, and easy-to-read examples. For the inexperienced network developer familiar with the C language, as well as the expert looking to pick up some extra tips, we provide information on and insight into a topic that is so often ignored, and yet sorely in need of attention.

Computer security is an ongoing process, a relentless contest between system administrators and intruders. A good administrator needs to stay one step ahead of any adversaries, which often involves a continuing process of education. If you're grounded in the basics of security, however, you won't necessarily want a complete treatise on the subject each time you pick up a book. Sometimes you want to get straight to the point. That's exactly what the new Linux Security Cookbook does. Rather than provide a total security solution for Linux computers, the authors present a series of easy-to-follow recipes--short, focused pieces of code that administrators can use to improve security and perform common tasks securely.  The Linux Security Cookbook includes real solutions to a wide range of targeted problems, such as sending encrypted email within Emacs, restricting access to network services at particular times of day, firewalling a webserver, preventing IP spoofing, setting up key-based SSH authentication, and much more. With over 150 ready-to-use scripts and configuration files, this unique book helps administrators secure their systems without having to look up specific syntax. The book begins with recipes devised to establish a secure system, then moves on to secure day-to-day practices, and concludes with techniques to help your system stay secure. Some of the ""recipes"" you'll find in this book are: Controlling access to your system from firewalls down to individual services, using iptables, ipchains, xinetd, inetd, and more Monitoring your network with tcpdump, dsniff, netstat, and other tools Protecting network connections with Secure Shell (SSH) and stunnel Safeguarding email sessions with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Encrypting files and email messages with GnuPG Probing your own security with password crackers, nmap, and handy scripts This cookbook's proven techniques are derived from hard-won experience. Whether you're responsible for security on a home Linux system or for a large corporation, or somewhere in between, you'll find valuable, to-the-point, practical recipes for dealing with everyday security issues. This book is a system saver.

遙想當年網際網路迸然乍現，平地一聲雷，燃起了無數人眼中熾熱的希望。網路經成了順口溜，不來上兩句，似乎就端不上檯面，而各式標新立異的網路詞彙，如每日一詞般從商界名流口中迅速拼造出來。似乎不懂網路，就落伍了，所以每個人都在摸索，皆暗地裡惡補著，深怕披掛的西洋鏡被人猜穿。可是說得天花亂墜，實際動手的卻少，何故？因為實際動手的門檻頗高。一來基本的HTML語法，必須牢記在心，二來可見即所得的網頁編輯器還沒問世，利用「筆記本」之類的文字編輯器撰寫程式碼後，還必須開啟瀏覽器程式進行測試，不滿意再切換回來進行修改。如此反反覆覆、改改修修，好不累人。後續動態網站技術現身，資料庫與網頁語言又是另一項必備的技能。雖然便利的網站開發工具陸續出籠，縮短了的技術開發的時程，但是隨著功能要求的提高，服務類型的增加，網站規劃又成了另一門更大的學問。因為光靠技術還不夠，如果沒有開發營運的實務歷練，根本無從瞭解整個網站的運作流程，更遑論經營一整個網站，以及應付一刻不得閒的資料維護與安全防駭工作了。「造車之前，先做輪子。」，其實也不全然如此。幾年下來，在嚴苛的網路試煉場上，前仆後繼，畢竟累積了不少成功的經驗。熱心人士口耳相傳，互相提攜。難解的問題，也都有人耐心回答。週而復始，良性循環，無形中成就了一個寶貴的技術資料庫。此外，更有實際營運經驗的好心人，將複雜的程式設計部分打包成一個單純的套件，流傳給其他人使用。這其中的佼佼者，當推架設入口網站的XOOPS、打造購物天堂的osCommerce，還有吹起的個人書寫風的部落格（Blog）。趕上科技潮流，可不是說說而已，起而行才是開啟智慧門的金鑰。為此，本書將詳細介紹XOOPS、osCommerce，並挑選最近頗為流行的部落格套件pLog進行操作示範，揭開以往不得其門而入的網站規劃面紗，讓讀者一窺營運核心最令人嚮往的一幕。如果，對以上這一切嫻熟且熱中癡迷，回過頭再將紮實的網頁技術研究透徹，即可全盤掌握，無入而不自得。回神望去，眼前本技術指南引導的顯然就是一條妙趣橫生、技術隨手可汲的悠閒小徑，不消多說，現在就讓我們出發吧！

The GNU/Linux(R) success story is well known. Firmly established as a high-performance operating system, its worldwide installations are increasing at phenomenal rates. Much of this success has been on the server side, but more and more PC users are turning to Linux on the desktop, as well.For those grounded in Microsoft Windows(R) or Apple Macintosh(R) graphical interfaces, the first look at a powerful Unix-style operating system can be daunting. This book provides a clear, no-nonsense introduction to the popular Red Hat(R) distribution of Linux. It takes you through installation and shows you the key parts of the system, always with an eye toward what can go wrong and what you need to know to get over the humps.Linux is known as a secure environment and a good platform to run a web server. These topics are among the many covered in this book. But did you know you can also burn CDs, sync a PalmPilot(TM), and edit slideshow presentations with powerful tools on Linux? Those topics are covered here, too.Red Hat currently provides two distributions, both documented in this book. The first is their commercial, subscription-based product, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux and also available through retail channels as Red Hat Professional Workstation. The second is the freely distributed Fedora distribution. The Publisher's Edition of Fedora is included in this book on two disks.New in this edition are installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, information on the GRUB bootloader, and the CUPS printer system.Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora tells you how to: Prepare your system for installing LinuxInstall and configure Linux and the two popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE.Run the most popular productivity tools on Linux: mailers, web browsers, OpenOffice, and Evolution.Obtain and set up software through the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)Set up a Linux system for networking, either on your local area network (LAN), or via a dialup connection to the Internet.Use the system-administration tools included with Red Hat, GNOME, and KDE, including such valuable utilities as Samba file-sharing and the Apache web server.Understand and write shell scripts so you can peek under the hood and extend the power of Linux.

在 Linux（以及大多數其他作業系統）中，網路程式設計最基本的單位就是 socket。就像透過檔案 I/O與檔案系統進行溝通，我們也可以透過socket 連上網路。Socket 其實就是程式用來定址以及傳送或接收訊息的連接點。設計網路或 socket 程式其實比設計單一工作或多工的程式更具挑戰性。因為真正的多處理器環境不僅會帶來更大的威力，也會導致更多值得注意的問題。上述的威力是無庸置疑的：只要將工作組織後分配給利用網路連接的電腦，Beowolf 之類的Parallel Virtual Machines （PMV）就可以進行更多的處理運算。置於隨之應運而生的問題，則包括了如何取得最佳的輸貫量，協調資料傳輸，以及管理 I/O 等等。本書將會說明及提供上述這些問題的解決之道。我們的目的在於滿足專業網路程式設計者的立即性與長期需要。掌握重要的概念，並且建立重要的應用程式。學習及掌握各種不同的 Linux Socket。設計單一執行緒、多執行緒，以及多工的客戶程式、伺服器以及對等程式。處理廣播及多重播送訊息。利用 OpenSSL 建立安全的 Socket，並且瞭解網路程式的安全考量。利用 Java 及 C++ 的 Socket API 進行設計。學習面對 IPv6以及如何轉換程式。使用 rpcgen 來建立專案所需的 RPC

A competent system administrator knows that a Linux server is a high performance system for routing large amounts of information through a network connection. Setting up and maintaining a Linux server requires understanding not only the hardware, but the ins and outs of the Linux operating system along with its supporting cast of utilities as well as layers of applications software. There's basic documentation online but there's a lot beyond the basics you have to know, and this only comes from people with hands-on, real-world experience. This kind of ""know how"" is what we sought to capture in Linux Server Hacks. Linux Server Hacks is a collection of 100 industrial-strength hacks, providing tips and tools that solve practical problems for Linux system administrators. Every hack can be read in just a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right answer. Some of the hacks are subtle, many of them are non-obvious, and all of them demonstrate the power and flexibility of a Linux system. You'll find hacks devoted to tuning the Linux kernel to make your system run more efficiently, as well as using CVS or RCS to track the revision to system files. You'll learn alternative ways to do backups, how to use system monitoring tools to track system performance and a variety of secure networking solutions. Linux Server Hacks also helps you manage large-scale Web installations running Apache, MySQL, and other open source tools that are typically part of a Linux system.  O'Reilly's new Hacks Series proudly reclaims the term ""hacking"" for the good guys. Hackers use their ingenuity to solve interesting problems. Rob Flickenger is an experienced system administrator, having managed the systems for O'Reilly Network for several years. (He's also into community wireless networking and he's written a book on that subject for O'Reilly.) Rob has also collected the best ideas and tools from a number of other highly skilled contributors.  Written for users who already understand the basics, Linux Server Hacks is built upon the expertise of people who really know what they're doing.

威力的軟體Linux
    作者之所以會出版這本《Red Hat Linux徹底研究》，乃是因為許多並不了解何為Linux，當然也就更不可能知道Red Hat 是什麼了！當他告訴人們說這是Linux的一個發行版本時，通常沒有幾個人聽的懂，所以作者為了回答大家的疑問而進行了寫書的計畫！

    從這本書可以知道 Linux 是一套發展齊全的作業系統，在多使用者的環境下，提供了全多功能。它所提供的高品質軟體，其價格比商業版的UNIX要便宜得太多了！於是Red Hat 決定將Linux往前推進一步。Red Hat Software 是一家電腦軟體開發公司，主要業務是銷售商品，並提供Linux 相關的服務。

　Red Hat 的任務是「為電腦專業人員提供專業的工具」。Red Hat 透過下列方式來提供專業的工具：1.建立工具，並將這些工具放在網際網路上的相關網站上，完全免費地提供使用者下載及流傳。2.發行書籍與軟體應用程式。3.生產透明包裝軟體－Linux OS的版本，使Linux 可以讓所有電腦使用者輕易取得。4.提供技術支援。

    經由這些種種的支援，使得Linux得以廣為宣傳，在加上出版了此書，進而使得此項技術得以流傳。

Linux這幾年的進步與發展，證明了一件事：「進步，始終來自於需求。」
就像會寫程式一樣，會安裝、使用Linux，曾經也是一種電腦高手的象徵。不過這幾年來，這樣的觀念卻慢慢地消失了。由於電腦的普及，還有Windows本身的昂貴與不穩定，越來越多的人希望擁有一套物美價廉的作業系統，原本就以穩定、高效能而且免費的Linux就在這樣的期待下慢慢走進了我們的生活。而我們將要在本書中介紹的Red Hat Linux 8.0，正是這轉變的最好證明。
維持著過去免費及穩定的特性，Red Hat Linux 8.0帶著精緻美觀的中文化圖形介面以及滿足全方位需求的各種應用軟體，出現在我們眼前。在本書中，我們將帶你深入體驗Red Hat Linux 8.0便利易學的安裝過程，也將引領你嘗試Red Hat Linux 8.0簡單易懂的圖形化環境，還要讓你學會如何安裝、新增自己所需的應用軟體，我們相信，這一切將會使你知道：Linux不再是高手的專利，而是一套親切易學、好用易上手的新世代全方位作業系統！

目前足以和Windows相抗衡的作業系統，當屬Linux為主，但其複雜的操作介面卻令一般使用者對Linux卻步，在Linux推出了操作介面親切的Linux Mandrake 8.2推出後，一般的使用者終於可以放下以前對於Linux難用，不順手的觀念，輕鬆使用Linux了。 
完全「類Windows」的操作環境，鐵定讓你有時根本分辨不出來是在用Windows還是用Linux，而且在作業系統中文化的程度上，也讓人十分的讚賞，對於硬體的支援度，那也是其特色之一，再加上剛推出不久的OpenOffice 1.0版（也是免費的，與MS Office幾乎完全相容），為何還要去使用數萬元的微軟軟體呢？ 
如果是一般人只需要上上網路，打打字，聽音樂，MP3，看VCD，處理一般的文書處理，試算表，投影片，或是架架伺服器與資料庫，其實用免費的Linux與OpenOffice就已經完全滿足一般的需求了。 
若是中小企業，業主更值得嘗試Linux，省下來的錢能提高公司的EPS，而且也不需要另聘MIS專員來處理類似的軟體問題，因為在本書中將一一的為您詳細解說。 
為了方便讀者安裝，我們特地隨書附上了3片安裝光碟，讓讀者們不用再耗費上網下載的時間，就能順利安裝Linux，讓我們攜手一起進入Linux的世界吧！

Linux網路應用
　Linux的網路應用是一項重要的議題，尤其是在商業應用伺服器時，在坊間書籍中，只是蜻蜓點水的介紹，並無詳細設定解說。本書的目的在於引導讀者真正架設一個穩定、商業級的伺服器。

　在Linux的Sever程式中，Samba  Sendmail、FTP、Apache、MySQL都已經全面改版，我們不妨以坊間舊的內容充斥，而是最新版本的靈活運用。本書也介紹網頁內嵌語言PHP，配合後端最流行的MySQL資料庫，以及最佳的中文資料庫DBMaker，還有APache－SSL、SET，架設商業網站成為輕而易舉的一件事。

　在網路環境中，安全性是第一要素，本書也介紹網路防火牆  ipchains、路由NAT、SSL、SSH、SOCK  PROXY、xinetd，讓讀者可以無後顧之憂。是否想進階學習Linux的網路伺服器應用？本書絕不會讓您失望！

Linux 核心研究篇
　自從 1991 年問世以來，LINUX 吸引了越來越多電腦玩家的眼光。經過不斷的擴充與改進，LINUX 已經蛻變成一個穩定、有效率、足以肩負重任的作業系統。她不僅吸引了 Sun、IBM、HP、Compaq 等硬體廠商的關注，越來越多的軟體公司也願意支援她，其中不乏如 Oracle、Informix、Netscape、Corel 等國際廠商。

　而這個富有傳奇色彩的作業系統最可貴的一點，在於任何人都可以免費地取得她的核心程式碼。學術機構、私人企業等都可以修改程式碼以合乎自身的需求。而資訊科系的學生更可以藉由研讀這些程式碼來了解作業系統內部實際運作的情形，把理論與實務結合在一起。

　由於 LINUX 的功能相當齊全，程式碼因而相當複雜。本書能使讀者節省摸索的時間，並能對整個系統有清楚的概念；其中介紹了 LINUX 的內部機制，包含處理程序、排程、記憶體管理、處理程序間通訊、檔案系統與網路層實做。本書也告訴讀者如何撰寫設備驅動程式、模組的架構，而從 2.0 版起支援的對稱性多重處理，本書也提供了概念性的介紹。 

　　隨書所附光碟內含 Slackware 3.1 完整程式碼，Linux 核心程式至 2.0.27，PC Speaker 驅動程式及非常豐富的文件資料。

　　由於作業的疏忽，中譯本的參考書目部分只有書籍的介紹，卻沒有書籍的資料（作者、書名、出版年份、出版商），請下載正確的書目(16k)。

Linux應用管理
　首先為大家澄清一個觀念：Linux非UNIX，只能說是相容於UNIX的作業系統，更嚴格的說LINUX只是一核心系統的程式軟體，它是必須結合不同的套件才能真正發揮它的強大功能，尤其是應用於網際網路上的一套優秀的作業系統。再則，UNIX為一註冊商標，為避免侵權，所以皆以另外一種名稱來稱呼。因此Linux裡的指令幾乎適用於其他Unix系統和UNIX本身。

　既然是UNIX系統，則在指令方面就有字母的大小寫之分，這是有別於他Windows及DOS的地方。

　UNIX系統和DOS系統相同是屬於文字介面模式的操作，在很多場合是必然的，尤其是做系統的管理；當然它有一套強大的GUI介面的操作系統－－X Window，它是免費而且也有很多視窗管理程式都支援它。而在文字介面操作時，有些應了解的編排方式是需要知道的。

LINUX建構與管理
　Linux是一套免費的32位元多人多工Unix-like作業系統，同時相容於SYSV與BSD UNIX並且符合POSIX標準，所以它的運作方式和一般的商業UNIX系統很像，但是Linux系統的穩定性、多工能力與網路功能，早已是許多商業作業系統無法相比的。

　而且Linux還有一項最大的特色在於原始碼完全公開，在符合GNU General Public License的原則下，任何人皆可自由取得、散佈、甚至修改原始程式，而最重要的一點是，若修改了遵循GPL的Open Source Software的原始碼或是任何的文件，則同樣的，必須以GPL的方式將這份原始碼或是文件以GPL的方式釋出。

    第一章，十大熱門FAQs（常見問題）！不論專家、新手，每個人都在問的Top 10精選問題解答在本章一覽無遺。

    第二章，是UNIX的入門，讓您對UNIX有概括性的了解。接著由第一步登錄開始，進而悠游其中。再來，您可以從本章學會終端設定的方法，也將懂得搭配最適宜己身工作的按鍵組合；最終，教您如何挑選安全的密碼，讓人難以破解。

    第三章，告訴您在UNIX的目錄、檔案架構下悠游行走的捷徑－－如何為檔案命名？如何找到在UNIX檔案系統汪洋中，被人遺忘的一葉孤舟？如何以最迅捷的方式在目錄間穿梭？

    第四章，專注在vi的介紹，幾乎在每個版本的UNIX，都可見其芳蹤的vi是個功能強大、且具彈性的文字編輯器，（雖然學習它的過程，常令人感到有些驚恐）。閱讀本章，您將學會許多聰明的方法加速您的文字編輯。

    第五章，讓您對個人化您的工作環境，有新的想法。UNIX啊，基本上來說，實在是有點醜醜的作業系統，所以本章肩負起，在提昇使用效率的同時，也不忘美化其工作環境的使命。將用便利的捷徑引領您設定好提示符號、顏色以及其它想妝點的地方。如果您必須常常切換於UNIX和DOS之間，您一定會特別感覺到，兩者間的轉換再自然也不過了。

    第六章，討論列印。在UNIX的環境下，列印這碼子事，能夠弄出一堆複雜的問題。本章教您，要快速地完成列印工作，到底該知道些什麼？在網路上，如何分享印表機，不用跳腳地輕鬆解決列印工作。

    第七章，教您以最有效率的方式執行程式的各種訣竅，深入淺出。舉例來說，執行前景運算、背景運算的方法，以及如何將它們搭配使用。

    第八章，來到最酷的UNIX圖形化使用者介面－－X Windows。本章將告訴您設定字型、使用滑鼠及個人化最適宜工作的操作環境。本章更涵蓋一些有趣的、伴隨X Windows而來的小程式的說明，也告訴您哪些程式乾脆可以不予理會。

    第九章，帶您逛逛UNIX系統下，好用的工具花園，您可以從中隨意挑選您工作上常用的小工具，從本章「竊取」UNIX老鳥的密技。這裡的工具面面俱到，幫助您穿梭UNIX系統之間，也提供您舉手之勞處理檔案的妙法。逛完此章，功力倍增唷！

    第十章，著重在與其它電腦的連結。使用UNIX，卻少了網路連結，對UNIX來說，真是太大才小用了，UNIX可說是最擅長於網路溝通的。在本章，您將學會使用「魔法語言」來與其它電腦溝通，以期得到該有的回應。順帶一提，第十章還告訴您一些網路遨遊的小禮節喔！

    第十一章的重頭戲是整合UNIX和NT，您將了解UNIX和NT互相對談的方式，以將兩者接合的天衣無縫。此外，您也會懂得設定UNIX機器為NT群組的一員，再加上更多的合作模式。

    第十二章，教導缺乏經驗者，如何避免因疏忽而造成對UNIX礦藏的破壞。由於UNIX沒有內建的安全防護措施，使用UNIX有時的確是驚險刺激的歷程。這一章包含了許多在別處難以發現的知識，讓您維護您工作環境的安全。最難得的是，這些有創意的技巧方法，都以最容易消化的面貌呈現書中。

    第十三章與您分享Korn Shell語言。您將學到其中變數、參數的使用方法，也會知曉Korn是如何做數學演算、處理字串運算以及Korn Shell語言提供了哪些事先定義的變數？最後（但不是最終喔！），則是Korn Shell程式輸出輸入的流程控制。

Linux的傳奇
　Linux，一個越來越讓人喜愛的電腦作業系統，就如同UNIX的誕生般，Linux的產生也是一部傳奇的故事，當時年僅21歲的Linus Torvalds受不了MS-DOS的虐待後，一氣之下寫出這套系統時，他從沒想過這套系統會讓他成為二十世紀末的風雲人物，讓他在各家媒體上成為熱門的話題。

　然而對Linus來說，他只不過很單純的做自己想做的事，完成自己理想中的夢，並且如居禮夫人一樣放棄了鐳的專利把成果無私地分享給眾人。他沒有想到竟有如此多的人，對Linux關心的程度遠超過對MS Windows的興趣，Linus也絕沒想到他的小玩具居然會威脅到Bill Gatez的神話王國。

　所以藉著這本書，將對Linux有限的瞭解提供出來，希望能對Linux的同好有些許的幫助。當然科技的進步是日新月異，變化速度之快，往往只發生在一剎那之間，作者會隨時修訂這本書的內容，並盡可能把修訂後的資料公開出來與各位分享。

Open source provides the competitive advantage in the Internet Age. According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun Microsystems to IBM to Intel.The Cathedral & the Bazaar is a must for anyone who cares about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young, ""This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems, and to the success of open source users and the companies that supply them.""The interest in open source software development has grown enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing the benefits of open source software has been key to its success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source within companies, independent vendors will become the open source story in 2001.

　在一九九九年，是Linux風起雲湧的一年。Linux開始圍攻虛有其表、看似不可動搖的微軟。因為微軟該害怕的不是反托拉斯案的分割結果，而是顛覆其賴以為生的智慧壟斷。

　故事的起是遠在一九八四年，當時很會寫程式的理察‧史托曼（Richard Stallman）創辦了自由軟體基金會（Free Software Foundation），大力倡導開放原始碼的觀念，努力打破電腦工業所形成的官僚體制障礙。然後在九○年代，進入林納斯‧托瓦茲（Linus Trovalds）的Linux時代，他是一位程式天才與資深史托曼信徒，而後在Linux作業系統上展現大師風範。

　自一九九一年托瓦茲公開Linux，以來，經過成千上萬的不知名工程師打造，造就出Linux自豪的穩定優勢。其「開放原始碼」的特色，更成了威脅其他軟體業者的最重要武器。

　本書敘述的故事即是關於：一個簡單的主意，如何能提供一個架構，組織數千開放原始碼使用者，而改變商務與追求財富的天性的過程。

　依照史托曼的理想，Linux的商業利基不在於「著作權」的法律保障，而是在於廠商提供的技術支援、教育訓練、為顧客量身定作程式的知識服務時代。

　一九九九年，RedHat為首家以Linux作業系統發展公司，而在美國掀起「Linux概念股」狂潮。後PC時代（軟硬體整合，即資訊家電時代）的出現，對核心程式輕薄短小的Linux來說，開啟了更新的想像空間。

Linux系統
    Linux是一個很不錯的作業系統，如果您未使用過它，相信您也聽過各種報章雜誌的報導，對於作業系統而言，它是一個不錯的作業系統。Linux以目前的功能而言，很多專業性的雜誌都將評比為Window NT4.0的產品，能夠得到這樣的評鑑，相信個為就了解它的功能不祇是個人電腦的作業系統而已，這是相當於伺服器等級的產品，所以是值得大家重視和研究的，假如您想跳入UNIX系統的領域，Linux更是您絕佳的選擇。

    如果您想在Windows95或98之外還有另一個選擇，就應該試試Linux作業系統，其好處當然不只是免費而已，最主要是在其功能強大的介面，並且能控制各種檔案系統，在Linux中您可以將檔案儲存MSDOS或Windows95vfat檔案系統格式，甚至您可以儲存OS/2檔案系統格式，在Linux檔案伺服器的系統中，您可以有各種不同的檔案系統的分割，並且若以Linux系統來當伺服器，也可以用Window95、98或NT來當工作站，光是這些功能應該就足以讓各位心動了。

網路實務
　本書採用穩定、效率高、免費的Linux系統，且輔以Linuxconf/Webmin簡單的視窗化介面，加上大量的實務圖例，說明現今網路伺服端採Unix，網路客戶端採Window的現實，完全符合快速建立企業網路及分層管理所需！

　本書是專為Linux的初學者及想要成為網路伺服管理專家的讀者所設計的，作者有鑑於現今市面雖然已經有許多關於Linux的書籍，但大多都是只停留於安裝或是基本操作的介紹，使得初學者難以入門深入，而且甚少是關於實務管理的部份，更別說如何駕馭管理搭配網路使用了，等於是將Linux的強大功能埋沒了。

　以作者多年的網路實務經驗而言，利用Linux系統來管理網路實在是一項不錯的選擇，有很多人認為Linux既然是一個免費的軟體，那它的系統穩定性和網路架構一定會比較差，其實這是一個錯誤的觀念，以作者的經驗來說，Linux的架構並不比以上說的網路套餐來的差，甚至比那些網路套餐還來的穩定。
